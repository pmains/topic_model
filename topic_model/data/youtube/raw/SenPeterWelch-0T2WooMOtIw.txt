thanks Rebecca hello Donald it's it's really really great to be here um this is where my uh legal career began amongst my law partner Donald Graham and it's where my political career began you know uh in 1974 which is when I came here Patrick Leahy was running for the U.S Senate and uh I was Donald and I were public defenders here in White River Junction and I volunteered on Patrick's first campaign and we met him uh I met Patrick and Marcel uh at the at the Coolidge Hotel and I couldn't believe it because Marcel was getting all set to move to Washington uh and at that point uh it was just before the headline came out that the Leahy campaign is doomed because there was a poll that came out and I was a volunteer for Patrick here in Windsor County and uh of course he went on to this extraordinary career serving us and serving the nation for 48 years and then a week ago on Tuesday Patrick walked me down the aisle to take the oath of office to succeed him in the Senate so yeah so it it was really it was real it was very special and obviously nobody's gonna uh be able to replace Patrick but you know we've got a tradition here in this state that is really quite extraordinary of Public Service uh and my hope is that I'm going to be able to continue to meet that standard that Patrick was so wonderful at uh we'll get to the questions right away but let me just step back a little bit and put in a context to where we are because so much of the stuff that's happening you know we saw what happened in the house with those 15 votes uh and the speaker now speaker McCarthy essentially having to capitulate to very far right radical right folks uh to change rules in the houses is going to make things much more difficult for us so you get caught up in the news of the day and it can be somewhat discouraging but you know it's extraordinary what has happened in these past two years if you step back and take a look you know January 6 two years ago you know I was in the building when it got attacked and that came within an eyelash of literally overturning a democratic election and as sad as it was and as scary as it was when I was in that chamber and the mob was breaking down the door and when the shot was fired it was even worse at three in the morning when we came back in 147 of my colleagues voted against certifying Joe Biden as the President of the United States and what that indicated was that we were in for the Battle of our democracy to preserve it that was very very serious and as we saw with the January 6th commission it was concerted it was deliberate it was planned it was financed and at the center of everything was Donald Trump and we then had two years to try to put the house back together in this past election if I get excited about anything in the outcome of the election and it's not just that the Senate state democratic and it's not just that the house Democrats held on not quite to a majority but not that 60 or 70 vote over a reversal that people feared there was a decision that America made to repudiate the election deniers that is really the best part of what this last election was about because the Democracy that we have is the tool we need to address the challenges that we face like climate change like income inequality like lack of Access to Health Care like the high cost of prescription drugs you name it if we don't have a democracy to be the tool that we can use to try to address those problems it's going to be really really really bad so I'm really excited about the fact that the American people made what I think is a major decision and we can build on that and obviously you know I've had the chance to serve uh in this in the in the in the House of Representatives for 16 years uh the things I've cared about are no different now that I'm moving in am in the Senate and it'll be standing up for democracy it'll be fighting on climate change it'll be fighting on all these affordability challenges that everyday Americans have folks who are trying to work and they can't afford Child Care the cost of housing that's getting so brutal not just in Vermont but all around the country trying to deal with the challenges of immigration all of that I have the opportunity to work on on behalf of vermonters and behalf of the country and I just got to tell you on a personal level it's so wonderful to be here in White River where I started where Donald and I played on a softball team where I practice law and where uh all of us are gathered together again so let me stop there and open it up for questions and comments but it is really good to be back home in downtown White River Junction any questions coming up do we have to come up to the microphone yeah lights up we got a request for lights up yep all right what else can we do we got stage stage Direction advice yeah uh yes my name is Kim Aiken I'm from Windsor and uh you mentioned the border and I'm just curious what is being done about the Border crisis well let me put this let's talk about this number one it's a serious problem okay the 2.5 million people showed up trying to come into the United States for all different kinds of reasons so it is a serious issue there's there's a you here and here are the issues that I think are have to be addressed one is how do we deal with that and what the president is doing is trying to increase not only enforcement but also the Asylum process that just isn't going to be able to accommodate 2.5 million people what's one of the causes the major causes the collapse of governments in Nicaragua in Cuba uh in Haiti and Venezuela where people are so desperate that they're actually making this hike across the Darion gap down in and and adapt in Panama so those challenges root cause challenges have to be part of how we address that second we've got to have more legal immigration we have not had an effort for immigration reform comprehensive immigration reform that includes border security but also a legal Pathway to citizenship for folks who are here legal immigration to help us with our Workforce challenges legal immigration for people who are getting phds in this country and can stay and want to stay so my view it's got to be a comprehensive approach that includes the Asylum process and procedures that work President Biden is doing that it's also got to include a legal Pathway to citizenship and it's got to include more legal immigration to help us in our country um correct me if I'm wrong why didn't President Trump seek to create legal immigration you know president Trump politicize the issue when we had an opportunity in 2014 to vote on a comprehensive immigration Bill the Senate passed one people like John McCain and Patrick Lee he voted for it we were not given the opportunity to vote on it in the house Mr Boehner did not bring it up and I got to tell you my view president Trump politicized the issue he did not look for a solution it was a political issue that he used to stoke Division and not try to solve the problem and I know if you remember this but I was appalled by this we started a policy where when family showed up it might be a single woman with two kids or a couple with a couple of kids the policy of the United States government was to take those kids from the parents and separate them that was outrageous and it was intended to be punitive and to keep people from coming that's not a policy I can support and that was that was the Trump policy it's better now you know and first of all let's say let's let's stop a minute I think that policy is outrageous okay Better or Worse we can't be doing that separating parents from kids and by the way some of those kids have still not been reconnected to their parents that's not acceptable what's happening right now is these collapsed governments a lot of violence a lot of climate change degradation so people can't even eke out a minimal income is driving people to come up here so we've got to deal with that because it's not as though we can have an open border which appears to be your concern and I share that no I think that the board I think part of the body wants to all these people to come up here so they're both Democrats yeah I'm I'm on okay Senator um I know I know you're probably aware of the fact that Under the Kennedy administration uh an initiative was established called partners of the Americas right and uh Vermont became partners with Honduras and I know that both you and and Senator Leahy have done much to uh to help in Central America um the issue that I'm most concerned about is uh is uh uh cafta the Central American Free Trade Agreement and also NAFTA which was the North American free trade Union and those agreements uh in my view totally undermine the rural economy of these poor Central American countries it's a total imbalance and uh and I think as a consequence uh people uh because they have no alternative are streaming to this to this country and so I I hope that uh some of your efforts will be devoted to looking into and perhaps uh reconsidering and rebalancing this country's policies that are implemented through kafta and NAFTA well two things Dean first of all thank you for the incredible work you've done in Honduras and I see my former colleague in the state house and uh right next to you uh you're right okay if when you have people coming here and they've literally up there they've picked their kids up and said we're leaving Guatemala we're leaving Honduras and we're walking to El Paso and that's literally what they do and they have to pass through a lot of violent territory where people are trying to exploit them attack them steal from them assault them that's desperation and people want to stay where they live by and large but they've got to have a chance to they've got to have some hope that they can pay their bills and live in some safety so anything we can do that helps deal with those root causes including trade agreements make sense to do so thank you hi my name is Fred Lerner my question is this what do you think can be done to try to get the Democrats and the Republicans and The Independents in the Congress to work together to accomplish something at least you know [Applause] uh Fred that's the heart of the challenge we face in this country okay and here's how I do it this is how I try to do it I did it when I worked with Hannah in the State House the challenges we face I'll just name a bunch of them real lack of broadband high cost of housing High Cost of prescription drugs you can be in a red District that voted big for Trump or you can be in a blue District that voted big for say Patrick Leahy the folks who live in those districts are afflicted by the same challenge we all need broadband and I worked hard on broadband while I was in Congress and created the rural Broadband caucus as a Vermont member of Congress I'm a delegation of one I was oftentimes in the minority and when I would approach my Republican colleagues I didn't indict them because they voted for Trump and I voted for by let's say I asked him how's your broadband we got in a conversation because their Broadband was lousy you know we're having this debate about 5G I say we've got a lot of places in Vermont that's noji so you start working on what is a challenge for the people they represent and the people I represent and that's how I had the opportunity to be really successful ultimately on broadband the same thing with Telehealth you know how important Telehealth is especially in Rural America we created the Telehealth conference and I work with lots and lots of Republicans on that so that's the approach that I try to take and it's something we learn at town meeting so thank you for that question and you're absolutely right and I think everybody wants us to get things done and in fact I think in this last election what helped is Congress started passing legislation in those last several months it really made a difference effectiveness hi my name is Mary Elizabeth gay and I am a special respect for United States Army and you know there is one thing that we really need to address and have a conversation about um is the homelessness in Vermont um I see that more of the homeless people that are in Vermont are United States soldiers and um you know when we're putting them in tents we're putting them in in um anywhere where they can't be seen or addressed right there's there's buildings here in Hartford Vermont that could be used as housing for for homeless people and you know what it's not that I didn't try to find the owner of one building and start that project it didn't turn out um but what are we gonna do for the our vets you know and it's getting worse because some benefits according to vets are getting cut um like the homeless payment the HUD thing um so you know do we need to have more and more of us homeless to really to really um make an acknowledgment of it because we need to know we need to acknowledge it now well I want to thank you for that really eloquent and heartfelt statement on behalf of our vets and that's an area where there's been generally very strong bipartisan support but some of the things that have happened to vets are out absolutely outrageous suicide rate is higher among vets in the general population it's really tough when I talk to vets they're over there in Iraq or they're in Afghanistan they've got the unit they fight for one another and then suddenly they're back home and nobody even knows they were gone no one knows what they were doing they don't get that support that they had in that unit and as tough as it was I've had many vets tell me they felt closer and had more friendships than they did when they came home and people ignored them and then one thing that we worked on in addition to homelessness do you know how many of our vets got cancer as a result of having to be stationed next to the so-called burn pits that were like three or four football fields wide and uh were burning toxic stuff and they were breathing those fumes and when they got these illnesses cancer-related illness the VA said no treatment for you you can't quote prove that you got that in Iraq and Afghanistan and we had a vet right up here the Hartford Fire Department who died and worked hard with John Stewart his wife got involved and two widows up in the Chittenden County area who I work with and we introduced legislation and ultimately got the packed Act passed that is going to guarantee that anyone who has one of these respiratory illnesses and served in the vicinity in Iraq or Afghanistan is going to have access to full health care benefits so homelessness is a part of it but bottom line here and you speak very well about this if we're asking a man or a woman to go to war they do their Duty the cost of the war has to include has to include the cost to carry for the warrior so thank you [Applause] that are cobbling veterans to fall through the cracks yeah there haven't been budget cuts in the VA okay the remain I'm quite willing to talk to you about how we can spend the money better or do we need more but there haven't there have not been Cuts yeah and I got to tell you the Republicans and Democrats are on the same page on that by and large uh and that's an area of bipartisan cooperation by and large but thank you for speaking up on behalf of our veterans yes sir Senator thank you if I can turn quickly to immigration and refugees my name is Brian Dalton with Bennington County Open Arms I'm here with Mustafa and Nema who work our staff of the ecdc the Ethiopian Community Development Council that's in Brattleboro and we've been having a lot of success settling families in southern Vermont I will briefly ask your help going forward with the U.S citizenship and immigration service and U.S state Department's Visa process which I used to work the cases are taking so long as you're off you and your officer well aware and your office and Senator Lee's office and centers have all been helping the individual cases because the African adjustment act didn't make it through the last session of Congress um we'll need to quickly find another solution because humanitarian parole right for these people who've been here now in Vermont for a year will expire in the summer and many of them either need to uh they qualify for Asylum or the special immigrant visas because of their law service with the U.S military or the Diplomatic service and um many of their their ability to set down their roots and get their work lives going and their education going is being hampered by not having the paperwork there here already they're willing they're able um these gentlemen are working with them every day but they have um legitimately employers look at their documentation and it doesn't look like fully authorized to work here fully legally here they don't know what they're looking at right so it's adding to the trauma of that they had already been through so sorry I said I'd be sure but um looking forward to working with your office to get USCIS and state department better staffed in these functions to make sure that our new Afghan neighbors can get their lives going thank you um well um thank you for the work you're doing uh and the folks who are with you are from Afghanistan welcome and thank you and I just want to acknowledge something I mean the folks you and others we're doing things like interpreting for our soldiers you're saving their lives we can't abandon you you didn't abandon us and we have to have a system where you get a yes or no you get an answer promptly and you're not left in limbo and I want to tell you I'm apprehensive about this because we're now not in Afghanistan but a lot of folks who helped us into whom I believe we continue to have an obligation are and the folks Afghans who helped us and are here are entitled to a quick turn around on your paperwork so you can get your lives going I mean I'm just going to ask everybody here could you imagine what it would be like if things started falling apart right around here and you'd been helping and you're told hey in 22 hours you've got to be at the airport and we're flying to a country you've never been to you don't in many cases speak the language you don't have a job you know that's what's happening and that's tough so we've got to try to ease the path as much as possible and I just want to finish where I started and then is to express my gratitude interjecting the other important issue is family reunification right almost every family here got separated in that right a quick evacuation process from their children right from their spouses and the family reunification humanitarian process is also um quite backlogged families have been separated for now years thank you thank you very much foreign good to see you thank you for coming to our town again one of the most important roles of the position you're in now and I think one of the things that Senator Leahy excelled in was bringing Federal money home to Vermont and a lot of that is obviously contingent on seniority and positioning so being new in that office I'm curious how your um approaching that and how we as vermonters might expect things to change at home for us if at all uh well there's there's two things rocket one is uh Patrick was unique he was the chair of the Appropriations Committee that's not a bad job to have for Vermont okay if you're not chair of the Appropriations Committee then it's not all about seniority I mean having that position is really unique um and uh Patrick used to tell a funny story uh with his colleagues who when they were trying to get money uh Patrick would say well we all do it alphabetically but apparently V became before a when it came to the states so I'm not gonna I'm not sure and won't be chair of the Appropriations Committee and 98 other Senators will not be the chair of the Appropriations Committee but there's a couple of things that we can build on uh number one a lot of what Patrick did he's institutionalized like for instance the small state minimum has been really really helpful to small states and I'm already talking with my colleagues from small states about our advocacy for the small state minimum and interestingly enough Susan Collins uh the Republican from Maine has been a benefit their state has been a beneficiary of the small state minimum so she is going to be the ranking who is the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee secondly again this is a credit to Patrick a lot of the things he did he got embedded into ongoing programs Lake Champlain for instance you know that's scheduled to get 35 million dollars for cleanup in the next five years so we're working very closely uh with with Patrick's we have been working very closely with Patrick staff to do everything we can to continue the work that he's done a third you know there's an area where Patrick was really wonderful uh among other places and that was in foreign aid and the work that he did in some cases in Central America that was in the work he did on land mines that's the work uh that I think is heart and vermonters that uh we're doing our share and we have all the list of the things he's done and we're going to do everything we can to continue that so I'm not Patrick uh and I'm not the chair of the Appropriations Committee uh but I'm persistent I find allies who are similarly situated and will be Republicans and Democrats to help their small states and we'll do every single thing we can rock it uh to make certain Vermont is taken care of and then some uh hi Senator Welch Joe Paris I'm from Vermont uh Norwich Vermont um so you made a pretty powerful statement earlier about how these past midterm elections were kind of a referendum on uh you know those who denied the election and uh Joe Biden's appointment of president I think another another piece of that referendum came with the overturning of Roe v Wade and the general outrage that there was towards the Republican party uh about that and the general sentiment that it made uh to women in general about how the federal government now wants to dictate their Access to Health Services no no the court court sorry um I'm just wondering you know given the fact that uh Republicans lost majorly in these past midterm elections or didn't see the sort of red wave that they wanted to um do you think there's going to be any chance that Democrats are going to be able to look at some of their uh conservative colleagues and maybe try to get them to come across the aisle a little bit when it comes towards legislation regarding abortion and Women's Health the uh first of all let's talk about the court the Court's outrageous okay it's become very politicized it's the worst Court we've had since pre-civil War that's my view and what they are saying in the doctrine that they used in order uh to overturn Roe v Wade is saying that there's no such thing as substantive due process that unless something is written in the Constitution itself like abortion then that's not protected and it's up to the states and of course that could apply to interracial marriage could apply to birth control you know the list goes on and that is just a retrograde majority point of view that manifests itself in the decision of returning Roe v Wade so that is a real problem and it's going to take some time to solve that I mean I actually think we've got to deal with the court I'd like to have court I'd like to have term limits for Supreme Court Justices and where every president would have the opportunity to appoint a couple of justices because the terms would roll on so there'd always be at least the capacity of the voters through their decision on who should be our president to weigh in on the kind of person that will be nominated and considered for the Supreme Court really an attack and it's why why it's so important what we do in the States you saw with us in Vermont we passed the Constitutional amendment by an overwhelming majority to protect reproductive freedom for women in the state of Vermont so the states are going to be very very very important in protecting those rights so that's good for Vermont but when I talk to Vermont women yeah they're really glad that we passed that Constitutional Amendment but I haven't met a Vermont woman who is satisfied that her right is because of what her zip code is as opposed to who she is all right so we've got work to do and that will continue this in Congress I do support term limits uh but I it will I am pointing out how important it is what we do in the states to protect rights yes it's a Jordan green Jordan how are you I'm from New Hampshire um I saw debrief I've given the the setup of the new of the new uh uh uh how the hill works now um it seems to me that it's going to be very easy for not much to happen given the the house and the Senate uh control but in terms of things that need to happen um whether it's my opinion of funding for the for Ukraine or some Health Care reforms still or the debt ceiling do you have any thoughts on how we'll get anything proactive well first of all let me tell you why am I wrong no you're not wrong we've got uh we've got a house uh that is Republican majority and the new rules in the house are really favoring the radical right and there's a real question as to whether we'll get a budget or a government shutdown there's a real question of whether we'll default on our debt or deal with the debt ceiling those are very live questions but I want to put I want to say something that's I think really really important whatever the outcome of those battles are we've got to be effective spending and implementing the programs that we started the inflation reduction act had about 500 billion dollars that is going to help us address climate change and presumably according to best calculations bring carbon emissions down 40 percent below 205 2005 levels that's hard work to make that work okay that's really hard work to make it work in the Administration has to be focused on it and Congress has to be focused on making certain that that money is well spent so that's an area where implementation and Effectiveness is going to be the best at the the best advertising we can do to get another shot in the next election from people who have confidence in us the same is true with infrastructure you know we're going to get a couple of billion dollars in this state it's about Broadband build out it's about roads and bridges it's about cleaning up our water well that's hard to do you know it's easy well you have these huge battles about getting the appropriation and it's hard but then you get it and then the real hard work begins how do you make it work and that's where people like rocket and folks in the local communities who are on the boards of civil Authority are on the boards of the select boards uh have to do that really really hard work so that's something we've got to be paying attention to the other thing we can do is we've got to really be addressing even if we don't get there these challenges of affordability that are really tough and making a difference in people's lives I mean it's really really impossible for people to work if they've got a couple of kids and they have no affordable child care it's really hard on a lot of our employers when their workers can't live anywhere near where the job is and that's a housing challenge you know it's really really tough when the cost of Health Care is going up so much and we can talk all we want about access but if the cost keeps going up and up it's not going to be affordable whether the taxpayers paying for it whether the employer is paying for it or whether it's coming out of your pocket I mean let me give an example of the rip-off the covid vaccine saved us many lives 26 bucks is what it cost for each one of those doses and that was because there was an agreed upon price so price negotiation between the government and moderna and Pfizer 26 bucks the government paid for it okay even after the government by the way put up billions to build manufacturing facilities in advance of a proven vaccine so that when the vaccine came we'd be ready to produce it that was a time limited deal Pfizer and moderna who made billions by the way I'm glad bless him made billions is now raising that 26 price to 130 bucks right and the cost of each one of those to manufacture is under three dollars that's not right it's just not right and you can go through case after case example after example in healthcare where that's allowed to happen so your government has to play a role in protecting consumers against that kind of price covering so there are things that we can do and should do and keep up you know a strong compelling argument to stick up for everyday people who are trying to make it through life and pay their bills yes Senator Welsh I'm Sarah Jackson with vital communities we're a regional non-profit working to used to be on your board yes sharing that thank you um I'm I'm interested in um what you have to say about this unique Bi-State region that we're in many of the issues that we're working on like housing and child care energy and climate we're seeing very Progressive responsible policies here in Vermont and people shaking their heads across the the river saying we're not getting much support on these issues in New Hampshire and I just wonder is there anything that can be done at the federal level to try to help buy state regions like ours who are wanting to thrive and seeking Solutions I have good news for you Tula best members of the United States Senate are Maggie Hassan and Jean Shaheen and well they are and you know uh we we share rural interest and we've been talking uh as I have been talking with my colleague Angus King and Susan Collins uh there are we're looking for ways we where we can work together to the benefit uh of our similar situations uh you know I can't I can't answer for what's going on in Concord uh and we'll try but bottom line uh that's a really wise thing to do when there are some areas where it may really make sense for us to partner and by the way what you're underselling What's Happening Here in the in the Upper Valley I have seen how our employers are coming together and trying together to help on housing and they just want people to be able to afford to live close to where they're working whether whichever side of the river they're on so you know what I've it's been amazing to me my time in politics to see how employers have started to really step step forward on things that they when I first got involved in politics didn't want to have anything to do with child care housing you know Health Care all these things that they know their employees need and these are employers by and large who really care about their employees and are really becoming a political force on behalf of policies that make those things accessible but thank you for your work thank you hi there my name is Linda Miller I live right here in Hartford um so I don't know that there's anything that's going to be done about it but it really irks me to no end that when aft during the pandemic and we had the PPP money and and the cheaters got in there and stole from my point of view billions and billions of dollars what's going to become of that money are we going to get some of that back and in that same vein this nonsense about well we're going to defund the IRS because you know why would we need to pay our bills um what what's going to happen with that well uh of course I totally support the prosecution of anybody who misused any governmental funds okay and how much we'll get and uh some of those folks who created false employees and got those checks they should be prosecuted punished in anything we that we can get back we should so I think all all of us I think really agree with you on that the IRS issue shows what the battle is I mean the last Congress put money into the IRS to allow them basically to get modern computers and adequate staff to be able to answer your question when you call and also do audits uh particularly audits of very wealthy individuals who have been skating by in a lot of our corporations that really don't pay much by way of taxes and the first bill that first or second bill that the new House of Representatives passed was to get rid of funding for the IRS and by most accounts it's about 400 billion dollars a year in unpaid taxes that comes uh you know there's not many of you who pay a billion dollars a year in taxes are owe that much so I don't think you're getting away with anything but bottom line if you're going to have a fair tax system uh you've got to collect what's due from the people who have the capacity to pay but just don't before you go back to those who are struggling to pay more so thank you good evening Senator Wells thanks for joining us here this evening congratulations to your election in the Senate uh in your remarks you mentioned climate change in a couple times in your responses and I was thinking that your approach you reference like with broadband and reaching to colleagues and hearing what's happening in their districts Etc and here we are in mid-January in Vermont and kind of a weak winner once again the white River's Bank full and you might expect it to be frozen this time of year and I'm I'm wondering if the northeast states might align with their senators and members of Congress and develop a shared statement around what is really the loss and erosion of the Four Seasons right right and the importance aesthetically recreationally and economically to northern states of that I appreciate your comments on that approach well I'm for that approach but I want more than a statement you know I want a real action that in policies that can be implemented that'll reduce carbon emissions so we can get our winners back and you know the Northeast region is that among the Senate is is United on that so I favor that but more than a statement we've got to have action and by the way I mentioned earlier effectiveness making things work you know how much climate denial we've had and it's bizarre because it's right in front of our eyes but you had people denying that it really is happening that wasn't so much denying the science that was the fear of what was required to make the transition well do you know an interesting you all know Marjorie Taylor green yeah all right she's starting to brag about solar because in the inflation reduction act as a result of the incentives in there and this was a piece of legislation that John ossoff got in all right wonderful Senate young senator from Georgia uh there's going to be a two and a half billion dollar solar panel Plant built uh outside of Atlanta 2500 good paying jobs right so that's my point about Effectiveness that's a policy that when it works and you can build on it then the argument goes away from the bogus science denial into the bragging by Marjorie Taylor green about these 2500 jobs that are in her District so we've got to make things we've got to get things done and we've got to implement uh and do that yeah very friends um hey Greg hi how's it historian I'm going to ask a so much selfish question maybe you can give us a Civics a little bit of civics education if you're at liberty can you give us any insight into what took place last week when they were on the debate or on the election of the speaker in terms of what the Democrats considered and didn't do as what they might have done um might they have voted for a republican might they have nominated Liz Cheney or done any I mean was Iris be interested in if you if I know you're not in the house any longer could give us some insight into what was transpiring both on the Democratic we know what was happening on the Republican side well I I think the Democrats were thinking Gregory uh I was watching like you kind of amazed and what was happening is you know traditionally the the majority party's going to have the speaker and what happened was that there was a stick up uh by the very radical element of the Republican party that was in a position to block any election unless the candidate in this case Kevin McCarthy capitulated to their demands and they made demands and they want and I think it's gonna it really bodes uh very dangerously for what lies ahead and these big issue things what the Democrats could have done I mean you're saying and there was discussion about this that they get behind what I would call a governing Republican you know there's a lot of really good Republicans uh that I've worked with here in Vermont and are I've worked with in Congress you know they they may have different points of view about taxing and spending and how fast to do this or how slow to do that but they believe in democracy they believe in compromise they believe in governing and they believe that we all have a duty as representatives to try to make progress and not just make academic points so there was some theoretical possibility that the Democrats could get behind a what I'll call governing Republican but I wasn't in the conversations about how that would happen it and uh I would have loved to watch that though I'm with you on that Gregory so my the shirt version of my question is we are in White River Junction is there any possibility of our you're getting money for the train system in this country [Applause] we got some money for trains but we we need a lot of money for trains and we need to make a commitment to the benefit of that policy we have a lot of challenges in the Northeast uh and improving the train bed the train tracks is expensive and difficult rights away are really difficult but it's a worthy effort and as you know uh the so-called high-speed train you know in the western part of the State uh is higher than it was but it's not high speed like people and it wouldn't be recognizable to people in Europe okay um so the the battle continues that's something I've been involved with uh since I was on the transportation committee uh in the in the state senate uh so thank you for the reminder to keep at it yeah um yeah you know I'd I'd like to first of all I go to the Norwich dump and I see my Senator dumping his trash right next to me in a T-shirt and jeans and I'm really proud that you're our senator you know I I can't stay away from the job you know my first campaign I'm interrupting telling stories uh but you know how people do door-to-door campaigns I did a dump to dump campaign and those are in the good old days when Chandler Hewitt from Pomfret was over here at the Hartford dump and uh and it was you know you brought yourself in and threw it in the burn pile I mean I can't say that now I mean I didn't do it but he had a 22 down there and he used to shoot the rats it's just uh uh could you teach us how it seems too coincidental that of the 500 people in Congress they almost always vote for their party's legislation and not the other parties I can't imagine that each group is so monolithic in their thinking that they they don't think oh that idea is a bad one I'm not going to vote for it all I've already is the good ones if there is a party system threaten the individual people are there incentives in place how is it that people seem to both a party line so often you know it's worse than the house than in the Senate and there's two things about that there's been a real breakdown in the committee process in the house and to some extent in the Senate you know in Pre I'll I'll date it with Newt Gingrich committees had a lot of authority and if legislation was going to be considered it had to go through the committee and a lot of the challenges had to be worked out and this is how it was and when we were in the state house and still is I think there so there'd be a lot of pushing and shopping debate about what to do but when something came out of a committee it oftentimes had bipartisan support that gave it a real shot on the floor the combination of in Congress the concentration of power in the speaker's office and to some extent in the leadership in the Senate has eroded the Committees but that's a real reflection of how tribal our politics would become in the country right so what happens now is that you do work your you work in the committee But ultimately a lot more of the final product comes out of the speaker's office and whether it's a Republican or Democrat it tends to get loaded up with things that make it impossible for the other side to vote the second thing is the tribal area of politics do you remember after President Obama got elected one of the things Mitch McConnell said was that he regarded his job was to make him a one-term president that reflects it's all about combat as opposed to about policy you know in Vermont we get it you have the fight in the election and then whoever wins we have a mutual responsibility Republicans and Democrats to now use our position to make progress for vermonters that's what we have to do well that's kind of faded away in DC and much to my dismay just a little bit Could you teach us what would happen to a democrat in the house if they voted for Republican bill you know nothing really would happen you know I voted for Republican bills and I work I work with them but it's not that it's not that there's what what it is I'll give an example a very concrete example I've been working really hard on prescription drugs okay there's two areas there's patent abuse where there tends to be bipartisan support and then there's price negotiation where the Republicans are really against it in the house and I'm really really for it okay we had an opera we passed patent reform out of our committee with bipartisan support but before that went to the floor the question was should we put patent reform into our price negotiation bill my position was no we shouldn't let's do them separately because it'll be really good if we can get a bipartisan vote on something I think is good they think is good and not make them vote on something they think is bad which is separate I lost that debate so the two things got merged together and it was a party line vote because the Republicans were against negotiation I totally disagree with them on that but they were they would have gone with us on the patent reform so my Approach on that let's do what we can together you don't agree with us on this other thing I think strongly it's important to do it I'll do it and you vote no and we'll have that debate and by who's right in the election Peter yeah hi yeah hi John yeah um about Aldi there's some governing Republicans so I just want to ask about that I'm trying to figure out how how is it possible that nobody can speak out against whatever is holding them back is there some thread against their life their children their families it is incredible that there is no and it could also be marketing and how we have the news just only promotes what it wanted to promote which is another issue we should be putting some good news out there I mean it's stressful listening to everything awful that's going on but also there it doesn't seem to be a single voice of independent thought with the Republicans it's like a End Mass kind of conversation I'm just wondering how is that ever going to be broken well you know the fever may be broke breaking now you know Trump had an iron grip on the Republican Party my view he destroyed the Republican Party a lot of us have admired over the years you know small government personal responsibility lower taxes and that personal responsibility often included not just your own behavior but your commitment to building a local bank or being on the volunteer fire department and Trump obviously made the party all about himself and it was really tough for a lot of my Republican colleagues because they in fact got voted out when they crossed Trump they paid a real price let's hope that's starting to change we need two good parties we need two good principled parties thank you a couple more questions my name is Justina um and I'm part of a group of folks from my area um in the Bradford fairly sort of area and the Orford Piermont New Hampshire area as mentioned before because we're such a both sides of the River Community um who are really working on food access for our neighbors and I am really disappointed to see that the extra covid related SNAP benefits are going to be ending um and I think it's going to have a really big impact in our community and I would love to just hear um your thoughts on how to sort of help with food Security in our communities um as on the ground in our communities we're trying to do as much as we can to support our neighbors but food prices have gone up for all of us so right thank you well thank you for your work and food security is an insecurity is huge uh you know covet showed how important it was to put money in to that and our schools did an incredible job you all know this but our schools when the kids weren't even coming in the school buses were driving around the route delivering meals to the families now it's amazing and I was just up in Saint Albans at their school and they've really created this Farm to Table program they've got kids in nutrition classes they've actually been serving four meals I mean that includes snacks and all the teachers I spoke to said it's enormously beneficial for the for the kids and it's for all the kids so you don't have to show that you're really poor and are going to be treated differently than your classmates so that's really a good investment and the farm bill's coming up so there's going to be a battle about what the funding is for these nutrition programs and food Security Programs and I'll be working with my colleague from the house Jim McGovern to do everything we can to make those as strong as possible but thank you for the good work you're doing Phoenix Peter online my name is Carl Bielenberg and I just have a question about Ukraine yeah I'm I I'm wondering whether Ukraine is already receiving some humanitarian assistance from the United States um and I'm asking it because I've not seen anything in the news about that I've seen that there was funds allocated for that but is that to be triggered like when the war is over or it seems to me they should be getting humanitarian assistance now uh there's been about 113 billion for military and that does include a smaller amount of that for humanitarian uh and obviously the rebuilding not just rebuilding but through survival getting through the winter uh and and and talk about food insecurity all of those just day-to-day living challenges to so many folks in Ukraine are facing we do need to supplement uh the military aid with humanitarian Aid and they're getting some but I'm sure it's not enough I think that's I read the last question yeah okay yeah thank you so Peter our Senator works I want to get back to what the woman over there very very eloquently brought up about our veterans um being homeless and and also the high suicide rate all right uh it's it's a really simple formula if uh if I can share that with you I am a veteran right and uh I'm facing eviction and there is not one single Vermont agency that will help I have a excellent caseworker through Bernie Sanders office um and she tries but it's it's futile uh the the Vermont Housing Authority no uh veterans ain't no all they want to do is yank you out of where you are they don't want to help you they want to put you in some place um there's uh Shadow subsidies no they don't help sefca doesn't help right because so you talk about suicide I work seven days a week so that I don't get thrown out of my home all right I also travel to my major job as a school bus driver over an hour one way wow okay and so what happens is a cycle of you work you eat your sleep and then the veteran looks around and says well gee what's this worth I've thought about suicide right and I will never ever tell anyone whether I will commit suicide or not because when I suggested it the Harford police came to my home forced me to my knees hand company behind my back dragged me to the cruiser okay and that left me with post-traumatic I mean I had nightmares I still do about that so um what you know has to fix the the agencies in Vermont had to be fixed so that they help the poor they're not doing that they're not even set up to do that I went through the whole Mill before vrap was done I was on that and of course you know what happened with that that's gone so what do you do when can when our legislators gonna fix the broken system so that poor people can survive I can't even get three squares not eligible well it's pretty discouraging to hear and I don't have an answer on how that will be fixed uh but I'd be glad to talk with uh you and and Bernie and his caseworkers see about the particulars of uh your situation I mean we you know we do a lot of case work it's really one of the joys of our job to be able to do that and uh what you're describing sounds like a nightmare well it's compounded because um I'm also a traditional Native American and the Lamont house does not recognize us as a people so if they don't recognize us as a people we're invisible with the invisible Nation yeah and you so yes I my caseworker at Bernie Sanders was working with me for two over two years wonderful person but her hands are tied yeah I'm sorry to hear that thank you well thank you all were are we entered yeah um thank you it's great to be here thanks for coming very much foreign

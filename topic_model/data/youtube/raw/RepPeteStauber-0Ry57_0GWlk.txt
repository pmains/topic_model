thank you now we return once more to representative snow burr Thank You chair Lorna Paul I appreciate it I want to continue my conversation but I want to restate the question and Commissioner Locka it'll just be a yes or a no answer because I've got other questions so as you said which I'm gonna ask this would you rather you're your power your County with elements harvested in places like northeastern Minnesota with great EPA environmental standards and union labor or would you prefer to receive them from places with an utter lack of Labor Standards and environmental standards such as Brazil China or Russia and that's just an either/or Thank You representative I prefer that any minerals are responsibly sourced and so I would say yes to your question and let you know that I work with yes solar yes to harvest them in Minnesota apparently and I'm taking a you represented that you have strong standards and I would say I would much prefer that then what's wrong much prefer Minnesota I would think however many of the companies are going on our public that's all I need worried that's the question that's that I'll gonna go to my next question I appreciate you supporting my great state of Minnesota mr. comer how long does the permitting process take for hard rock operations and how does that compare to mining in other countries with comparable environmental standards thank you for the question if you were to look at other countries sorry thank you for the question other countries such as Australia and Canada have very strong environmental laws and they take two to three years to permit mines and properties and projects just as complicated as those that we permit here one of the problems with the law is proposed as it adds new layers of NEPA analysis and the leasing decisions as the federal government chooses which land should be available and should not be available for further exploration after having removed 50% of those lands from availability in the United States a typical mine project hardrock mining project takes any right around ten years plus or minus next question how would you characterize the environmental protections in the United States compared to other major producers of critical minerals in the world such as China the United States has top of class environmental protections to say that there are no controls over how mines are developed or operated is it's just a simple fallacy the part of the reason it takes ten years is because of the 40-plus environmental and land management laws that have to be complied with no mine's going to open today that will discharge air or water emissions that violate the law our protections are very strong as they should as they should be yeah thank you for those questions I just want to chairman Lal and ranking member go sir I want you to know and other members of this panel I want you to know how important mining is to the state of Minnesota and this nation the critical elements that we mined copper and nickel we need mining to transition into alternate sources of energy windmills thousands of pounds of copper it can be mined in northern Minnesota following strict standards good-paying jobs and it'll be a great part of our economy we have permitted the very first copper nickel mine in the state of Minnesota that has met or exceeded every environmental standard and we're going to bring great paying jobs to this state it's called a Duluth complex it's the biggest precious metals find in the world and we can mine it safely following standards bringing great paying jobs to our community and we talked about reclamation I would invite anybody to come up to northern Minnesota's iron range I'll show you reclamation how it should be done we have deer we're harvesting hay we have bees we have ducks we have birds it's beautiful mr. second gentleman will yield where the gentleman answered me a question the cleanest water in Minnesota is located where in the Iron Range in reclaimed mines is that's correct I thank the gentleman

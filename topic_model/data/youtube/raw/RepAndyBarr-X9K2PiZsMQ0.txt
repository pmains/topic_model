iran's foreign minister apologized for the blunt comments that he made to journalists that were leaked to the press last week however while his apology was focused on his criticism of iran's late top general general solomonic and remarks related to the country's internal power struggles it's his comments related to the u.s climate czar or windsor john kerry that has some in the u.s calling for an investigation now during the interview iran's foreign minister zarif complained that iran's military has long kept him in the dark on crucial matters and that he had to find out about israeli attacks against iranian interest in syria from none other than john kerry now in light of this comment three gop house foreign affairs committee members wrote the u.s state department's inspector general last wednesday to demand an investigation into kerry joining now to talk about this call for an investigation is one of the house members leading the charge congressman andy barr of kentucky he serves as i mentioned on the house foreign affairs committee as well as the financial services committee congressman welcome back to the program tony great to be with you thanks for having me on now let's talk about this uh according to the leaked reports around 200 times john kerry gave sensitive information about israeli military operations primarily in syria to the iranian foreign minister this is quite significant is it not absolutely imagine a a u.s secretary of state former secretary of state divulging sensitive perhaps classified top-secret military-related information to the sworn enemy of the united states and our key ally in the region uh the state of israel and if these reports are true that not only did john kerry undermine our critical american israeli alliance he really turned his back on israel he he betrayed israel and i would argue because israel is this island of moderation and uh a democracy in an otherwise very dangerous part of the world uh he really he really threatened u.s and undermined u.s uh national security interests as well and this is this is a kind of a pattern for john kerry he has a very bad habit of cozying up with the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism we know this because he's not only the architect of the flawed iran nuclear deal but he clearly appears to be if these reports are true putting his own personal ego and his interest in salvaging this flawed jcpoa ahead of u.s national security and certainly above the security of our friends in in jerusalem now congressman do we know the time frame in which these revelations were to have occurred well we know that um that john kerry has admitted having two conversations with the iranian foreign minister muhammad zarif during the period of time when secretary pompeo and the trump administration the previous administration was directly in the process of withdrawing from the flawed agreement and reimposing sanctions and initiating a maximum pressure campaign if if that timing if that timeline is accurate then we have john kerry working directly at odds with u.s foreign policy something akin to a a shadow diplomacy that was uh actively undermining the official policy of the united states and and look i mean the that that that policy of the united states that former president trump was pursuing was an effort to correct a major error in foreign policy that the previous administration the obama administration had pursued a a policy of imp appeasement that that gave the mullahs and tehran billions of dollars in cash that enabled them to pursue a ballistic missile testing program and uh provide a huge injection of cash into the hands of iran's terror proxies which were in the process of destabilizing the region so iran used the iran nuclear deal to promote its terrorist goals through proxies in the middle east and president trump was in the process of reversing that when it appears that john kerry was was actively trying to undermine the official policy of the united states a policy that that that was intended to and in fact did uh re-establish deterrence against the world state sponsor of terrorism so my final question for you congressman barr is could this in fact have been could he have engaged in illegal activity something that ran fallow a foul of the law yes and that's why we believe we meaning congresswoman wagner and congressman zeldin why we wrote to the inspector general at the state department we want to know uh what the state department knew and when they knew it we want to know the status of john kerry's security clearance we want to know if as a result of these leaks and this shadow diplomacy uh this uh disclosure of sensitive military information about our key ally if if that put the israeli defense forces in danger of retaliation we want to know if there was any attacks retaliatory attacks launched on our israeli allies we need to get to the bottom of this and we want the state department inspector general to take this seriously it doesn't appear that the current secretary of state is taking it seriously because he dismissed our calls for an investigation as political it's not political it's about loyalty uh to our ally and defending u.s national security well congressman barb we want to we want to find out what you hear back and also find out what is discovered if in fact there is an investigation so we want you to come back on and talk about it thanks so much for joining us today thanks tony appreciate

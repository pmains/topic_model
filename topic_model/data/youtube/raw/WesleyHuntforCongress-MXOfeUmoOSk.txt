[Music] a maryland congressman and retired army colonel is calling for criminal justice reform in the military and more diversity in its leadership congressman anthony brown arguing quote the current military justice system has put service members of color at a disadvantage and left them subject to a commander-controlled system they do not trust here to react army veteran and texas congressional candidate wesley hunt wesley thanks so much for being here so do you know black and brown service members mistrust their commanders and the military justice system short answer is no and the way for us to end racism is not by teaching and indoctrinating reverse racism and again this is another push from the left to continue to divide this country based on racial lines we've seen it in politics if you're a republican that you're inherently racist we're seeing it with critical race theory we're seeing it now with our military they are attacking us and you and i both know pete that our military is in fact a meritocracy and the only thing that matters is the man and woman to your left and your right in accomplishing the mission that our country gives to us a meritocracy with standards that everyone is expected to follow black white colonel or private uh it's pretty straightforward here's another portion of the op-ed an excerpt from it that i think shines a little bit of light on where he's coming from it says the current military justice system is not serving our country's higher values of justice equity and fairness and there it is it's that it's not everything has gone from equality to equity which is a very different word it's an equal outcome versus equal opportunity and do you see that seeping into the way military now sees subordinates and commanders well unfortunately it is and when we were in the military performance is what mattered it didn't matter what you looked like my sister went to west point i went to west point and so did my brother we could all speak to what service means to us personally and it had nothing to do with what we looked like but i also think that this is actually a push to defund our military we are we've divided our country by trying to defund the police and i think the next push is is they d from the military defund the dod push and where does it end and that's why it's very important for us to take back the house here in 2022 to stop this push you know i had a black battalion commander in iraq a black s3 in in my battalion yeah that none of that was at issue or of even conversation when it pertained to his authority to make decisions about you know lieutenant hegseth and and my conduct uh considering where we've come as a country would you say the military today is setting this aside this whole idea of criminal justice reform a less racist institution than it used to be is it more of a meritocracy than it's ever been without this critical race theory nonsense just ask my father my father is a retired lieutenant colonel and he came up in the military during the 70s and the 80s and i understand that during that time culturally we were at a different place the argument that we are more racist now than we were then is absolutely ridiculous we have certainly evolved we have certainly now gotten to to a point where we focus more on the merit and the content of one's character in our military and that's actually why we've gotten so far and we've come so far in such a really short period of time so again this is again it's a power grab for the left to divide this country based on race we've got to stop this maybe it's because we've come so far that they now want to tear it down even more maybe you will be in the halls of congress able to take on legislation like this very soon wesley hahn thank you so much we will be thank you sir god bless you thank you

for more on this story we have congresswoman nancy mason south carolina joining us live here congresswoman good to see you as always thanks so much for joining us here the white house correspondent you just heard from announcing president biden said he's going to hold china accountable as we continue to follow what's happening here at the nato summit now in the g7 prior but really didn't do anything to meet with these leaders about the origins of kovas kovet but he said that he's raising taxes what is your reaction to what the president has done so far well it's perplexing and confusing what is president biden doing to actually hold china accountable a verbal reprimand is nothing more than a slap on the wrist he's even talking about punting the investigation of finding the origins of kovan 19 to the world health organization and we all know the world health organization is accountable to china what is he actually doing there it's really perplexing and confusing and watching him in these press conferences in these meetings he's doing nothing he's doing nothing for the american people the other thing that a lot of folks are looking forward to obviously is this uh obviously the nato summit but then this is ahead of the the putin meeting something that we were ironing out of how these press conferences uh will take place they will not be together they will be separate here's why president biden said he won't be holding a press conference with the russian president the best way to deal with this is for he and i to meet he and i to have our discussion i i know you don't doubt that i'll be very straightforward with him about our concerns and i will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out and he'll make clear how he from his perspective how it turned out but i don't want to get into being diverted by did they shake hands how far did they talk who talked the most and the rest he can say what he said the media was about and i will say what i think the meeting was about congresswoman would you prefer both of these leaders still hold a joint press conference being the fact that this president has really come out tough on russia it's almost like having a boxing match instead of getting able to watch the match you just get to see what the fighter said about the match right it's a very awkward speech by president biden too and the problem is we don't look strong right now and when when america is strong the world is strong the the other countries around the world you know they want us to have to show strength against china and russia and we're just not doing it right now it's the most bizarre thing i've ever seen out of a president in recent memory pivoting to another topic your home the finder says correctly was vandalized with expletives on an island near charleston south carolina take a look at this and then i'll get your response woke up this morning uh to my house being vandalized last night you can see they spray painted in black past the pro act on the front of my house that's my bike that one of the kids was using last night shortly before the house got vandalized it's very scary they also spray painted no gods no masters all politicians are bastards with antifa markings on it i believe that's daniel island out there i think a bishop of england a high school private high school out there with vandalized as well do you know who's responsible for doing such things is this cleaned up now do you have beefed up security uh what is the latest on that story um i absolutely have beefed up security and in fact i had a few cameras before all of this and i've tripled that i've had to triple that i now i've had my concealed carry permit for a couple of months but now i actually carry everywhere i go unfortunately it doesn't feel good when you don't feel safe and i don't even feel safe in my own home sometimes and so it's definitely been a different environment here at the house over the last couple of weeks my kids are just like just chill mommy we're gonna be okay but the police on friday released footage of the vandal that did bishop england high school back in february there was very similar graffiti done one evening at the end of february the the police have done a handwriting analysis and determined it is the same person unfortunately the video and the photos that they've shown are very very grainy i'm hoping someone in charleston or on daniel island might recognize the silhouette or the figure and give some tips to the police you know it's far past time for people to be held accountable for the political violence in this country it's got to stop yeah you know i i'm from charleston um i used to live in daniel island for a little bit i know it's even tough to get on the island there are only so many ways you can get on so it it baffles me to see this actually happen and how that would happen in a place like daniel island before you go i want to ask you about this the vice president is scheduled to visit your state today greenville south carolina kamalaires will be there in south carolina she will be i believe promoting vaccines getting vaccines but you'll also be talking about voting rights from what i understand in south carolina what do you expect out of this meeting um you know south carolina was a pivotal point specifically for the biden campaign in the past presidential election what do you believe the vice president's messaging will be for south carolinians today this afternoon well if she thinks that the voters rights if that voters are oppressed here she can she can think again we have a great system our state legislature and our governor we have voter id we have witness signatures on absentee ballots we did change our laws for the election in november we did a fantastic job there's no voter fraud here we've done a great job of ensuring everyone who has the right to vote actually has the right to vote and i sure wish she'd spend more time at the border right now we have an enormous crisis at the border that she's just turning a blind eye to and instead you know 80 percent of americans 70 80 percent of them they want voter id these things are okay and i'll be curious it's so curious to see her going to the upstate of south carolina which is a conservative bastion up there i'll be really curious to see with the reaction there but i'm really proud of the way south carolina's legislature and governor how we have great voting laws and sure everyone who has a legal right to vote has the opportunity to vote and look where we are today we've done a fantastic job with it that is south carolina congresswoman nancy mays joining us live here on a monday uh congresswoman thanks so much it's good to see you take care thank you as always i appreciate it

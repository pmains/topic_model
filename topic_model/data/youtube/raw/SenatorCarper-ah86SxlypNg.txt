I by state also talked as my colleague here just has about the federal budget the ones been budget resolution has been prepared for our consideration as results the conference it's occurred between the house and send this administration not didn't inherited a a day at the beach they raven-haired a tough situation we as the country been around I guess sort of officially since 1787 if you go from seventeen eighty seven to two thousand and one that's about I think it's about two hundred fourteen years and we ran up in that period of time roughly five trillion dollars worth of debt we essentially doubled that over the last eight years we're w in just eight years ago and was much near dad in the last eight years as we did in our first two hundred and fourteen years as a nation and I didn't hear nearly the kind of be moaning wailing about the growth and the deficit in the national debt during those eight years as we hear from it today from for my sins of friends on the other side of the the Iowa I think my colleagues know I'm not a real part of some guy but I feel like it's important to say oh this is this a hand we've been dealt so hand us administration's been dealt the question is what do we do about it and we have a couple of wars we're fighting we have a an economy that's worst since the Great Depression and we have to do something about it and one of the first things they decided to do about it is to try to joke the economy back to life I reminder these old blankenstein movies we haven't dr. Frankenstein in the lab and China and put two electrodes to the monster and bring the monster back to life jolt that monster like like we're trying to talk not a monster back to life we're trying to Joel to a Connie back to life in economist of all sides liberal conservative and everything in between have said you got to spend a lot of money and hopefully money that's largely used to produce jobs it will add two values earlier be for good public purpose in our country that's what we're done with the stimulus package the but as we go through this year and by the next year or so the deficit gonna be a whole lot bigger than certainly I'm comfortable with I was elected to the house but Sir there for ten years before became governor Delaware I was a deficit Hawk and in my heart I still am and what I want to do today is to talk about some things that we can do ought to do in some cases are doing to bring the deficit down further I'm encouraged when I hear the president say that the deficits large this year but I his goal over the next four years to reduce the deficit in half I think that's fine the important thing is we don't just stop there and if there's another four years in this administration or new administration it's important that we continue to make progress and drive the deficit back closer to zero I'm one of those people who thinks it's appropriate to deficit spend when we're in time of economic calamity a win we're in time of war and as it turns out right now we're in both and hopefully four years for now hopefully sooner than that we won't be in both and we can turn back are spending I think when it's when the economy sound we're not in a national disaster natural war in other places around the world I think it's appropriate to balance our budget in fact one of the things I his proudest of those governors we not only balanced a budget for eight years in a row we reduce taxes for seven years and we actually pay down our debt a little bit which made made me very proud and I know the legislature to hopefully will be in a position in the years to come much as we were in the 1999-2000 the last administration actually pay down some debt while balancing but the budget I've suggested the administration a whole bunch of things that we can do and I've talked about him here on the floor reduce the deficit I want to talk at length about one of them but I want you to mention the others as well in order to better match revenues and expenditures going forward we obviously cannot avoid the question of taxes with as far as I'm concerned before you start raising a lot of taxes the first thing maybe the better thing for us to do is to collect the taxes that are owed and the every year we're here by the tax gap rossman was actually officially done I think about eight or nine years ago by the IRS and they figured out that at the time we were at the tax gap monies owed to the Treasury and I've been collected by the Treasury about 300 billion a year but most estimates I here today it's maybe 400 dollars a year and if we only recovered half of that or a third of that we're talking about real money that would make a real debt dent on our deficit we make a lot of improper payments in this government of ours I charge subcomm you that has jurisdiction over that sort of thing and we know that our improper payments that we made in the federal government last year were right around 70 2 billion dollars mostly overpayments some underpayments and we need to do a better job at least we know now for most part where the improper payments are going order who always the department that are making them but we're not doing a very good job of actually going back after made an overpayment especially and we kept recovering the money recapturing that money we call it post auto cost recoveries and we're just beginning to scratch the service in one of our big entitlement brothers Medicare and Medicare program we start about three years ago hide some private firms and said I go out and mice that we've overpaid to providers or medical suppliers equipment suppliers let's go back and get the money that we've overpaid we're said we're going to do it in three states California Texas Florida first year this effort recovered almost nothing second year we've covered a little bit and last year we covered about 700 million dollars that's real money and the idea is not to just do it in three states but why will you do that in all 50 states I'm encouraged that we're going to do that and if we could recover that kind of money and over penguins for Medicare my guess we probably recover some money in Medicaid and if we have to two of our three big programs entitlement programs they're sucking up a lot of money one of the first issues that we should face there is reducing the overpayments and going after the money and recovering that which we have a spent or in some cases misspent third area that we need to focus on is the area of a major weapon systems spending a lot of money to go back to I think it's 2000 we hire overspending and major major weapon system cost overruns about 50 billion dollars in 2000 by 2005 we were up to about 200 billion dollars last year we're up to close to 300 billion dollars and major West weapons system cost overruns clearly that's an area that we can do better got to do better one of the things that I'd also mentioned is the president has most governors have recall a line-item veto power the ability to go and like line out a single line item in a new budget they have it by virtue of the Constitution so they can veto bills they can go through lines of their bills in invito lines and different pieces of the spending package that they've signed into law we have something like that in federal government it's called rescission power the president can sign appropriation bill into law submit that to the Congress and the Congress can vote it up or down but if we don't do anything then it kind of goes away and the president sends rescission messages to us from time to time and we don't do anything in the rescission the proposal really sort of goes away what a number of us have done 21 / sat then have co-sponsored legislation that we introduced this week Democrats and Republicans and the idea behind the legislation is when the presidents of science a spending bill not a tax bill not a revenue bill not entitled measured when he's finds out he or she signs a an appropriations bill into law that he would have she would have the right to send us a rescission message to propose to reduce resend spending in that spending bill we would constrain how much today the president could rescind if problems were authorized to rescinded more than twenty-five percent to run authorized there's there's no such limit we this long enjoyed over though the president would send a rescission message and we'd have to vote on it we could vote it down with a simple majority in the Senate 51 votes or in the house with 218 not a two-thirds override not both houses just a simple majority in either the house or the Senate we limit the time for this to occur in fact we limit the amount of years that this can be law to four years four years I call it for your test drive with enhanced rescission pires for president if the president abuses it the president should say to the presiding officer from Mexico unless you vote for my top priorities here I'm going to go after your top priorities and we'll make sure that they don't become law in submit rescissions to try to intimidate member of the Senate or a member of the house that could happen and as a result we provide for this four-year sunset after that slaw goes away if president's current or future abuses we're not going to continue to enjoy this particular power do I think this will balance the budget no I don't do I think it might be of some help yes I do with respect to earmarks among the things that we've done here is there's nothing inherently wrong with flow with it with the unmarked directed spending but when they are growing like Topsy is they work for a while that's not a good thing we've now decided to limit earmarks to one percent of a revenue which i think is appropriate the second thing well we didn't know for the longest time where monks were coming from who was asking for an earmark and we didn't know necessarily going to benefit from the year mark and we've addressed that so that we know both another thing that we've addressed I believe we've addressed is the ID I comb airdrops where you have a conference committee with the house Congress Committee with the Senate on appropriations bills you don't have an earmark in either one and yet out of the conference committee emerges an earmark for somebody and we don't know where it came from and it was not in either bill that that shouldn't be alone and the last the last thing I would mention is at the end of the day you have the ability for the president to look through a bill whether remarks or other forms of spending and I should have say maybe this is this is a bad idea this is a similar egregious form of spending they should be addressed and basically say to us in the Senate or the house I've sign this bill into law but I want you to come back and vote on a couple of specific items and I always said if we can't if I can't get 50 my colleague to vote for an earmark we're spending request that I've made on behalf of Delaware I can't get 50 of my colleagues to go for it I shouldn't probably be asking for that earmark in the first place but there you have it ladies and gentleman running short of it a lot of things that we can do can we continue to make progress and I know we're on our way to getting down to about three percent of gdp by the in the next next four years after this for years now I applaud that there's some other things that we want to do I look forward to working with our chairman of the Budget Committee

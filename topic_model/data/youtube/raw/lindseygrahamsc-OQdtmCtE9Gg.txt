we're getting downright reckless decisions of his entire presidency Barack Obama has selected his ambassador to the UN as his next national security advisor now while the left wants to spin Susan Rice's unwarranted promotion as some sort of partisan payback against Republicans the fact is this brazen act is a slap in the face to all Americans now Susan Rice did not tell the truth to the Republicans in the wake of the benghazi terrorist attack she didn't tell the truth to anybody now in a moment we're going to lay out the evidence that suggests that she was a co-conspirator and what was a politically motivated national security cover up but first here's the president from earlier today he was in the Rose Garden with her background as a scholar Susan understands that there's no substitute for American leadership she is at once passionate and pragmatic I think everybody understands Susan is a fierce champion for justice and human dignity Susan's the consummate public servant a patriot who puts her country first she is fearless she is tough as our ambassador to the UN susan has been a tireless advocate in advancing our interests I also said she was good basketball player but a tireless advocate and advancing our interests well that may be the case if he's referring to his political interests remember back in September 2012 at the height of the presidential election Susan Rice was sent on five separate sunday shows to downplay al Qaeda and terrorist involvement in the Benghazi attack instead she blamed the deaths of four Americans on a YouTube video and said it was spontaneous now considering the fact that Miss rice is about to become the president's top advisor on matters of national security it's very important that we look back at some of the things that she said just days after this consulate was hit and our ambassador was assassinated let's watch this this was not a pre planned premeditated attack that what happened initially was it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in Cairo as a consequence of the video what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo which were prompted of course by the video it began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what it transpired some hours earlier in Cairo now still to the state nine months later a number of important unanswered questions exist about Benghazi number one who is responsible for editing those talking points and pushing the YouTube narrative number two during the eight hours that Americans were fighting for their lives what was the president doing number three who ordered our military to stand down when they were ready to help those that were under fire now one thing is certain that thanks to today's announcement it's going to be awfully difficult for congressional investigators to ask Susan Rice any of those questions now why well because you wouldn't know it but her new post does not require Senate approval and even more importantly as a member of the White House staff the president can prevent her from having to testify by invoking executive privilege joining me now with reaction South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham he has been all over the Benghazi case senator welcome back that's a pretty darn good lead-in well just trying to lay out the facts thank you what's your reaction first of all well number one let me tell you what Greg Hicks said about Susan Rice's Sunday appearances this is the number two guy in Libya our second in charge diplomat the last guy to talk to Chris Stevens before he died he said when he heard Susan Rice appear on Sunday television he was stunned my jaw dropped and I was embarrassed she gets promoted and he gets demoted what's wrong with this story yeah what are the unanswered questions that you have because we still what do you think our responsibility is in all of this well number one I don't think she was an empty vessel that they just poured missing information through she also said and this is not in the talking points that the consulate was strongly significantly and substantially secured and she reminded the American people that bin Laden was dead and al Qaeda was decimated that's not in the talking points she was selling the strength of the president's foreign policy she was providing deceptive and misleading information about the true facts in Benghazi she has a credibility problem I think with the average American she is chosen by the President to be his national security advisor she was unconcerned about a secretary of state having said all that I will work with her because the world is about to blow up Barack Obama's foreign policy is a failure and our friends are scared our enemies are emboldened but what I want to know I want to hear from survivors nine months after the attack shine we haven't heard from one person in Benghazi nine months after the tap we don't know who on that Saturday before she appeared on the sunday television programs changed the talking points who who was in the deputy's meeting in the White House that went from the truth to garbage and changed the talking points and quite frankly we don't know anything what our president did during that evening they made two movies about the bin Laden raid he's given one interview after another about his leadership in the bin Laden raid and he deserves credit we don't even know when he went to bed I'd like to know when I first heard this my first reaction is all right this is the president because she doesn't need Senate confirmation I was poking it in the eye of Republicans well what was your first thought I thought is this the kind of person that name one person who has been demoted that was in a position of responsibility name one person who's lost their job because of Benghazi you know Susan Rice being promoted or being chosen as national security advisor after her performance in Benghazi basically is the president telling us I've got no problem with what my administration did in magazi misleading the American people basically telling a narrative that didn't hold water seven weeks before the election he's very comfortable with his leadership and what she told the American people and to me that stunning that he hasn't paid a bigger price another thought that crossed my mind i call it chasing rabbits all right that is with all the scandals the president's coming through yeah he wants to destroy wants the media talking about other things and obviously knew a disappointment everybody would talk about this do you think that maybe there is a trap set here for Republicans kind of hoping that Republicans are going to go out there and attack Susan Rice and Samantha Power's and hoping that they say something that's over the top I don't know if he's you know if they're that clever about it I just think the president has chosen somebody he feels comfortable with and I will work with Susan Rice because you know the Mideast is on fire right now the king of Jordans hanging by thread Syria's falling apart our friends in Israel 100 seeds the Russians are providing aside with very advanced weapons so I need to work administration what I can all right the quick answers will rapid-fire questions number one do we know with in Benghazi do we know why or who denied the additional security that was requested no but I think you have to blame Secretary Clinton because it was her job to provide security do we know who gave the stand-down orders no I want to know who told Colonel Gibson he couldn't go to the fight when he wanted to go to the fight but we know where the president was that night after he had been told at four in the afternoon I think everybody in Benghazi needs to know where their commander-in-chief was at night and what he did to try to help him and we have no clue do we know who after the original talking points were the truth they evolved into a web of lies do we do we definitively know where that came from we know it came from her group a meeting in the White House we don't know who was in the meeting we don't know who chaired the meeting and we don't know how it got to be from the truth to a bunch of garbage and I will not stop we find out we haven't heard from one survivor in Benghazi they have cut a small forest down trying to get that survivors made available to the Congress or stonewalling to Congress we're going to find out the answer to all these questions because the American people deserve it or they do and especially the families that lost loved ones US Senate actually families thank you glad you're staying on it thank you yes sir still

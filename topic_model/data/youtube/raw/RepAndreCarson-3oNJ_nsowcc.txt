Thank You mr. speaker mr. Speaker I rise today to honor a trailblazing public servant and an iconic Hoosier Mayor Richard Hatcher as one of the first African American mayors of a major American city mayor Hatcher was a constant source of inspiration not only across Indiana but throughout our nation and around the world his history-making election in 1967 as Gary Indiana's first black mayor showed the power of the possible that even in a state once controlled by the Ku Klux Klan a person of color could rise above hatred and into the halls of power where Hatcher's example advocating for economic justice civil rights and equality for every American is why so many of my colleagues and I are public servants his death is a sad loss for all Americans but his legacy and his work will live on we must all work together to continue his quest for greater representation and rights for all I send my deepest condolences to mayor Hatcher's loved ones and I thank him for life well-lived I yield back

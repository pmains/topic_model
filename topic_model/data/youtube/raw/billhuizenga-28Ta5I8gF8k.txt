madam speaker i rise today to demand a vote on h.j res 72 a congressional review act resolution that would end the cdc's mask mandate for airlines trains buses and other public transportation hubs tuesday night the senate voted in a rare bipartisan manner to end these mandates in what even cnn called a bipartisan rebuke of the biden administration policy states and cities big and small across the country have ended or in the process of ending their mass mandates at schools basketball games and even crowded restaurants thousands of fans will pack arenas in the coming days to cheer on their teams during march madness for example and at these games they rightly won't be required to wear a mask but as soon as they step onto a plane a bus a train or even a metro unelected bureaucrats at the direction of president biden have decreed that masks must be put on and must be worn so it's past time for this unscientific mass mandate to be ended i can i'm calling on speaker pelosi to hold a vote on repealing this mask mandate americans lives americans want their lives back and it's time to vote

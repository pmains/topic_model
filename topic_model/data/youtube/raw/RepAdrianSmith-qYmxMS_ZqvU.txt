the gentleman from nebraska mr smith to inquire thank you mr chairman thank you mr secretary for joining us here today uh some important topics certainly it's already been mentioned the the medicare solvency issue i think it's it's like some things have changed some things remain the same since you were here just a year ago i was disappointed i i too was disappointed to see that when the budget not address the medicare issue that we know is is very important not even mentioned in the budget now more specifically you know the the medicare trustees report uh actually issued and you're a trustee as well a medicare funding warning which requires the president to submit to congress propose legislation to respond to the warning within 15 days of the submission of the budget now we know it's been a month since the budget was released so it's impossible to meet that 15-day deadline but uh will he meet that requirement or have you indicated uh as such uh the need to to meet that requirement congress said at this stage uh there has not been any action to move in that direction okay well certainly i i hope that we can certainly abide by the the trustees that very diligent work i and there's i think opportunity to work together on that and so i hope we can head in that direction i think it's obvious that operation warp speed has been very effective and now we're able to talk about post pandemic we're not all the way out of it but we are able to talk about a post-pandemic future rather than just wishful thinking so on the transition phase i i'm concerned that little in the in the budget actually seems to indicate that besides a diminishing uh need for certain covet specific resources there there just aren't aren't other things obvious when you were here last year i talked about telehealth and how important that is to expanded access for everyone i was working on that for rural purposes before the pandemic we know that the need is greater than just for rural purposes so we know many people are depending on this and telehealth as well is not included in the budget and i'm concerned about that so we're actually going to now see a cliff of sorts uh because uh the deadlines or the expirations and sunsets uh on on telehealth so while some limited provisions received a 151 day extension past the end of the public health emergency in the fy 22 omnibus passed last month it's obviously an extremely short window and it left out critical flexibility is essential to run even rural and underserved providers in the telehealth arena is lack of attention to the post-pandemic telehealth in the budget because you believe that the provisions and the omnibus are adequate or what would you say is the the posture there congress first i agree with you that uh that extension of time the five-month extension for those authorities on tele indispensable especially in rural communities underserved communities we hope that uh we can continue to work with you to actually extend those authorities because we will need statutory changes to make that possible um if you take a close look at the president's budget you'll see that he actually does address how to move forward it's that plan that i mentioned before it speaks not only to covet but beyond covet and the preparation we need we hope you'll take a closer look we do need that read those resources okay so would you say the administration does support extending the the telehealth provisions especially for critical access hospitals we've already indicated absolute support for extending some of those provisions many of them have to be worked on because you know that there's some issues for example moving across state lines there are issues there among states on how you do that but we absolutely do believe that we have to keep some of those telehealth authorities in place okay thank you back thank you

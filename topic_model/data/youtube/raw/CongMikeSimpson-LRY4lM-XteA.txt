eja the environmental or the equal access to justice act uh it is very difficult to find out how much money we have paid uh from that fund as you know it is it is an act that it is set up with the best of intentions help pay for attorneys when they bring lawsuits and prevail uh how is that handled by your department who pays it is it the justice fund is it your department if they have a lawsuit and end up paying attorneys fees is there any way to get an accounting of government-wide how much we are paying into this fund as you know there are organizations probably organizations on both sides of the of issues that almost look at this as a way of funding their organization is there is again is there any accounting is there any way of determining who assesses the fees that are being charged and so forth uh that we is can we get that information i from what i understand originally there there when it started off there was a an accounting of that the public actually had access to it and then it just kind of disappeared and has has been nobody nobody knows congressman simpson that matter really is something which comes from the department of justice because that's where the judgment fund is is that who pays it it's uh it comes out of the judgment fund for example in the cobell litigation that we've been involved in the money that ultimately would pay for the attorney's fees uh and in fact for the entire for the settlement is money that comes out from the from the settlement fund so i think it's you know that's a question which i would be happy to uh raise with the attorney general if if someone sues the blm over a grazing permit and goes through all the court procedures and a settlement is made blm doesn't end up paying the age of fees for that plaintiff it is the it is the justice fund i i believe that to be the case uh congressman simpson but i will check further on that and and get a more specific answer back to you or perhaps this is something that pam hayes might know something about and i'm not trying to ask this in a in a a way that says it's not justified or anything else i just like to know how much we're paying and if we appropriate if we if we appropriate money for it or whatever but if you could get back to us on that i i would appreciate it let me just ask pam since she apparently knows the answer to just provide the answer my understanding is that the department of justice pays it and they have an accounting um and we are supposed to over time reimburse those costs through appropriated dollars through whatever means you can appropriate if it was a mandatory account where we you know the action was related to that way so essentially the department pays for those one way or not in the long run i think it's fair to say most many of the departments have not been keeping up with all of the reimbursements because we have not been able to find an accounting of who's getting these fees and how much they're being paid i'd sure like to find out but anyway i'll follow up with you on that and see if we can it's an important question and let us let us get some information back to you that i appreciate it we'll be uh responsive to your question i appreciate it uh last year we appropriated a million dollars to address the backlog in grazing permits uh this year omb and the department left that out what are we doing to address the backlog in the grazing permit uh permits and trying to trying to get that up to speed so that we don't have the problems we do with the crazing going on in across the country director abby has been very involved in addressing this issue as uh i don't know whether yet he's whether he's specified before the committee yet but he was uh director uh and working at the blm for about 30 years director in nevada and he's aware of the grazing fee permit backlog and i know that he is working on it according to pam's good notes here at the end of 2009 there were 4 326 grazing permits that were backlogged and about 90 percent of 18 000 permit let me just say we're working on it we appropriated money last year to work on it that money's not not proposed in your budget added on top of that 109 million dollars throughout the department in fixed costs that have to be absorbed by the department somewhere uh assuming as i said during i think it was the hearing at the blm that you don't hire people just to drink coffee there is going to be something that doesn't get done there will be fewer people to do something to do some activities than other things how are we going to address the backlog in that in that arena and others if uh if we're have reduced personnel and so forth in the future

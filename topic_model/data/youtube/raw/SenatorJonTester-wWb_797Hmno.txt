My father was Edmond Juneau, his nickname was “Snackery” and he served under Patton in World War II. This is a picture of him when he was in the service. My grandma always had that. And when she passed away I got it and I’ve always kept it. Me and my brothers were talking about it one time and nobody knew what happened to his Purple Heart. And so I told them I’ll see what I can do
and Tester took it from there. And pretty soon he notified me and told me about all the medals he received, which was a shock for us. We always thought he just earned a Purple Heart but when we got the medals I was really surprised at all the medals that he did that he did receive. He was highly highly decorated. Pretty impressive, in fact the whole family
was pretty impressed. He had never talked about it. We met a guy one time that served with him. And my dad never talked about, but the guy said that they were pinned down and that my dad was shot and it was two days before the medic could get there, he never quit fighting. He kept shooting and he said he was really a good solider and that it took a couple days before they could fix him up and stuff but
he didn’t quit. Yeah, this is a citation here that the Senator’s read on the Senate floor and it’s part of the Senate record now about my dad and his accomplishments. And that was really a surprise, we didn’t
know he’d do that. So that was really nice of him, we feel really honored that that happened. And then he brought them all in and presented them to us here in Great Falls at his office. And he was just super easy to work with, yeah he did a really good job and we'll forever appreciate that.

statement the 2007-2008 financial crisis and subsequent global economic turmoil underscored the interconnectedness of the global financial system as well as its weaknesses following the crisis leaders from the United States and other countries have pursued a wide range of reforms to the international financial regulatory system in 2009 the group of 20 or g20 created the financial stability board as a group of finance minister central bankers and financial regulators tasked with promoting international financial stability primary US representatives to the FSB are the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasury Department the FSB is charged with a very broad mandate to address vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system and to develop and promote implementation of effective supervisory and regulatory policies promoting financial stability according to the FSB while its decisions are not legally binding on its members quote the organization operates by moral suasion and pure pressure in order to set internationally agreed policies and minimum standards that its members commit to implementing at national level end quote however to ensure domestic implication implementation of SF FSB standards the FSB has adopted measures to pressure jurisdictions to comply with these criteria since 2008 the FSB has aggressively designated large banks and insurers as global systemic sorry global systemically important financial institute institutions or GC fees in fact in July of 2013 the FSB designated nine large insurance groups as GC fees including three from the united states american international group prudential financial and MetLife incorporated shortly thereafter the F sock appeared to rubber-stamp the FSB's decision and named AIG Prudential and MetLife as as Cyprus if ease although the AIG decision was expected by many since the company had famously been bailed out by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis it's unclear as to why Prudential and MetLife were deemed sippys if the SF Sox IPPY designation has any validity it must have the ability to act into in Italy meaning without interference from international regulatory entities describe how each decision was reached for example the Prudential decision was the first designation of a non-bank financial institution as a SiFi although the firm had not yet suffered any significant financial distress during the financial crisis however the available evidence indicates that rather than exercising its own independent judgment about SiFi designations and other regulatory initiatives the f sock led by the Treasury and Federal Reserve instead out sourced its regulatory authority to the FSB it is very troubling that American regulators would relinquish any regulatory authority to unelected European bureaucrats who meet behind closed doors in a secretive fashion to determine the fate of US financial institutions because very little is known about the FSB I have very serious concerns about the arbitrary decision making process used to formulate policy that is devoid of any and all public participation it is important to note that the FSB has no supervisory authority or regulatory power to compel compliance with internationally agreed standards however it appears the FSB has become a shadow regulatory agency using backdoor channels to determine a one-size-fits-all approach to applying European standards on American financial institutions even in today's challenging economic environment America has consistently outperformed our friends across the Atlantic I find it mind-boggling that US regulators would allow themselves to be quote unquote pressured into seeding regulatory sovereignty to the very bureaucrats who have crippled innovation in ground economic growth to a halt in Europe it is completely unacceptable and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on these issues the chair now recognizes the ranking

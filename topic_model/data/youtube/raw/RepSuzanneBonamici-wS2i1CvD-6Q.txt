thing today by supporting the bipartisan protecting older workers against discrimination act we can protect the civil rights of older workers who are striving to provide for themselves and their families according to recent data from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics the percentage of retirement age Americans in the labor force has doubled since 1985 unfortunately age discrimination in the workplace remains disturbingly pervasive according to the AARP three in five workers over the age of 45 reported seeing or experiencing age discrimination on the job Americans are living and working longer and we must do all we can to protect them from discrimination my home state of Oregon has one of the most rapidly aging populations in the country and I've heard from workers many in the technology industry who believe they have been dismissed or denied employment because of their age my office has helped older workers who have filed h discrimination complaints at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but the burden and the outcomes are very uncertain in 1967 Congress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act or ADEA to prohibit age discrimination in the workplace and to promote the employment of older workers then in 2009 the Supreme Court in the gross case changed the burden of proof for workers and made it much harder for workers to prove age discrimination this bipartisan bill simply returns the burden of proof to what it was four decades before the gross case I joined chairman Scott and congressman Sensenbrenner in reintroducing the bipartisan protecting older workers against discrimination act to amend the ADEA and our other civil courts core civil rights laws the anti-retaliation provision of title 7 of the Civil Rights Act the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 we need to make our laws clear unlawful discrimination in the workplace is unacceptable I think chairman Scott and congressman Sensenbrenner for their work on this important issue I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and I yield back the balance of my time

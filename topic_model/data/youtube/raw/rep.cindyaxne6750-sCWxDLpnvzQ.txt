Thank You chairman and thank you commissioner Montgomery for being here very much appreciate it we've been talking a lot today of course about increasing home ownership and addressing the shortage of affordable housing across this country so one of the issues I want to take a look at is manufactured housing because in many cases it can cost up to 30% less and in some cases more for folks to be able to afford that so if we're going to talk about it though we have to make sure it's a way to provide affordable housing and truly make sure that it is I don't know if you're aware of what's occurred in Iowa over you know the last year or so but I'd love to give you a brief background unfortunately a company named Haven Park capital which is a fund from Utah has bought now seven manufactured housing communities in Iowa and then they proceeded to raise their lot rents for the residents there between 20 and 70 percent so they came in and just raised the rate 20 to 70 percent for these families many of whom are on fixed incomes I visited one of those communities Midwest country estates in Waukee and saw firsthand the terrible position that these folks are really being put in and just yesterday I spoke to one of those residents Matt Chapman who's about to be paying 70 percent of his income for housing we know the standard definition of severely cost burdened is paying 50% of your income on rent and here's a constituent who owns his home outright has no mortgage and has to pay 20% more than the 50% that we think is severely cost burdened so he doesn't know what he's going to do and many of his neighbors just don't know how they're going to make this happen it's just simply unaffordable for so many residents like him and others across the country many of these properties were purchased with federally supported loans so we need to make sure that our constituents aren't being taken advantage of because they can't relocate and these are the kind of predatory practices that unfortunately are being allowed to continue so I'd love to ask you commissioner you know I've been working on trying to find solutions to prevent this from happening again and given your experience in housing I just wanted to ask you what what recommendations do you have that we should be putting in place well and I'd be happy by the way to follow up but we have more time to discuss it but manufactured housing is you know 22 million Americans of the manufactured housing we regulate the construction of manufactured housing and throughout the country between my time is Commissioner last time and this time the technology the construction standards and all that has made leaps and bounds so much we're almost having a hard time keeping up with it we've also been looking at the financing aspect relative to FHA there's title one in title 2 not getting to in the weeds here the title one doesn't have a lot of volume in it tends to be more sort of what I call shadow loans versus the traditional FHA title two we think there's a way to make it more affordable because you thought in your be referenced earlier my opening statement the average income of a manufactured a home owner is between thirty and fifty thousand dollars a year so again it's part of the things we're looking at and sort of a pro consumer aspect ways that we can perhaps get some of that cost of financing down we have less purview being honest with you on sort of the structure of communities again more so the regulation of the the actual manufacturing of it of the yeah of the structure okay well I appreciate that and I would love to see what information you have at least three of these seven properties were bought with Fannie Mae loans and you know it's so it's not as if federal government's not involved in it I hate to see that we believe that they actually overpaid as well for the the community that I was just talking with you about I'm sure they they did and I think that we could have if we had pieces in place those owners could have pooled together and possibly purchased it for themselves and been able you know to stay in their homes and not just to afford it but when we see these kinds of predatory actions they're asking children to literally give up their dogs because they're too big for the homes according to their new rules they're forcing families to tear down swing sets that they don't think are I guess good-looking enough but these aren't people who can afford those two thousand three thousand dollar rainbow sets the some other people can so any help that you can give us these people truly have been put in a position where they don't know what their answer will be many of them will not be able to afford this and will be forced out of their homes including taking their children with them and not being able to find an affordable option so I'd appreciate your follow-up on some of those things we just talked about and any other things that you might think we could put in place absolutely I won't look forward to following up with you or your staff on it thank you thank you

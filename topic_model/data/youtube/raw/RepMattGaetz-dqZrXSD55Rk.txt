right out of you today joyless Behar called out yet again over her rampant hypocrisy let's take a look his adult to Trump supporters he doesn't care about you he doesn't care about your health or your children's health he only cares that you come and supply kudos to his massive ego there's a lot of hypocrisy to go around here and this is one of the issues that I'm really enraged about the message from the media is as long as you are protesting something or going to a rally that is of the right politics you can do it and we're gonna ignore the spread of kovat still going to a trump rally is somehow much more dangerous than going to a rally in Brooklyn over the weekend their post they summed up the double standard perfectly with a cover showing the sick hypocrisy here with reaction Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer and Florida congressman the ever so funny but at times the little edgy mean Matt Gaetz is with us Owen you Sean thank you Matt I feel I feel singled out I've real thank you okay I think Donald Trump just don't call it a rally call it a protest it's really unfortunate that you see this double standard and it's quite something coming from the view to talk about people's egos they have extensive egos I also think that you know you don't see the Biden campaign complaining a lot about the rally restrictions because I'm not sure that Joe Biden rallies would crack the ten person limit while we see that radical left becoming more woke we have to continuously be even reminded that Joe Biden is awake at all and I think that the energy difference in the campaign certainly favors President Trump it's why the media doesn't want to see Trump supporters getting together and sharing that energy and joy that's central to his campaign ari Shawn what you're missing is a study of liberal public health administrators and scientists has shown that kovin knows the cause and if the cause is good COBIT will go around it it won't infiltrate but if the cause is bad the vibration knows it and I'll just get those people he doesn't it's called a protest it's everyone all appreciated that but I hope people do stand back and realize the damage that public health officials have done to themselves when they say that there are certain protests that are meritorious therefore go ahead and engage them and we will not charge you for going out and violating social distancing but we will if we don't like your cause this is a terrible injustice and it's not what public health people should be doing and it shows how corrupt the media is congressman gates yeah it does and one of the lasting effects will be that if we have other pandemics other crises where people have to rely on public health or whether you'd like people to be able to count on what they see in traditional news now folks aren't going to do that they're going to see the naked partisanship that is informed on the public health advice and on what we hear from the mainstream media and it's really unfortunate because it doesn't allow us to come together as a country and solve these problems but you know I I sense that there'll be a tremendous amount of energy in Tulsa that the president will draw from that energy and continue his great work the executive order he signed today was absolutely transformational it's really going to improve policing and he's going to have a lot to campaign on all right I'm Matt by the way and re of both good guys

we've been at war in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years and more than 2200 US service members have died this president promised to end the forever war but instead his mismanagement has placed our troops at even greater risk and there's still no end in sight and now we're learning that Russia may have put a bounty on American servicemembers in Afghanistan so I went to a classified briefing today to find out what's going on and what President Trump has been doing now don't worry I am not about to reveal any secret information in fact I can't reveal anything about what President Trump is doing because the defense officials sent to brief the Armed Services Committee have no idea what President Trump knew or when he knew it apparently they know nothing zip zero so why would these briefers be sent over to talk with the Senate if they know absolutely nothing what is the White House trying to hide was the president really not briefed on something as important as Russians putting a bounty on the heads of American soldiers as his administration seems to claim or was he in fact in the loop but he did nothing and how does any of this fit with Trump's talking with Putin did he raise the issue how did Putin respond look I don't know the answers but I promise you this I'll keep asking until we get some answers the American people have a right to know whether the President of the United States is defending the lives of American troops or not and our servicemembers have an absolute right to a commander-in-chief who will always have their back

okay thanks so much good morning everyone and thank you for being here this is uh a great day in chicago we're kicking off spring with a little bit of sunshine and a little bit of rain and very traditional chicago style so i really appreciate everybody sharing some comments today but especially appreciate congressman peter defazio is here he's the chairman of the transportation infrastructure committee and he's going to share some uh interesting information regarding the next package so we're excited to hear about that you know today's convening of state and local officials throughout the chicagoland area represents the start of our statewide collective effort to ensure that president biden's american jobs plan becomes a reality in our communities this is truly in every way a once in a century capital investment to put our country on the right track and to build back our infrastructure and local transportation systems and before i speak some more on what this plan means for illinois in the chicago region i do want to allow chairman defazio an opportunity to speak to the work we're doing in washington right now up until this point and the work that we have ahead so chairman the floor is yours uh thanks marie and uh thanks to chewie 2 who uh slogged through this process in the last congress with me the the president you know you said it beautifully once in a century i i was on a msnbc show this weekend they said once in generation i said no this is way more than generational i said we have i said in terms of our surface system yeah we've been living off the eisenhower legacy that's at least two generations more like three and but we have rail and other assets that are critical water main sewers that are 100 more than 100 years old so uh this is an incredible opportunity the the president has set down a good marker uh you know the uh the starting point for anyone who wants reference uh would be uh what was in hr 2 last year in the house it won't be identical um they are evaluating my section the invest act which was the largest single portion um you know their numbers are a little higher on transit a little higher on rail and we could very productively spend that money i'm fine on that and i was chatting uh with folks with murray beforehand uh i had put in authorization for states to use uh their funds to you know remedy past inequities where communities were divided especially with aging infrastructure the president actually called out a skyway in new orleans and said this thing is about to collapse it's got to be rebuilt but we're not going to rebuild it so it continues to divide the community we're going to find an alternate route for the traffic and they want to dedicate 20 billion dollars to make up for uh past inequities so that's that's good news so the the sort of four major points are uh it's green uh we're going to deal with fossil fuel pollution transportation being the largest single contributor in the u.s uh for now it's electrification in the future we may be using hydrogen but right now that's not pragmatic we can move quickly with elect electrification then uh and we partner with the energy and commerce committee to produce more renewable power so you're not charging cars off gas plants and reinforce the grid so we can wheel that power more seamlessly around the country the second objective is to build it resilient a resilient to known and potential threats with climate change severe flooding sea level rise on the coasts and the west we've got to build it resistant earthquakes and fire now so to anticipate future threats and build it in a way that lasts longer no more 60-year bridges 100-year bridges we have new materials that are actually more climate-friendly in their production including concrete we can have the footprint very quickly with concrete and in fact at oregon state in my district uh they have uh they're experimenting with carbon negative concrete uh carbon uh concrete is seven percent of worldwide co2 pollution so that that's a big move and then um we're going to do it uh made in america uh by american this is going to create millions of jobs the estimates i've seen are are pretty phenomenal in terms of how many million jobs we can create uh with these investments standard and poor's came up with a great report they just updated it uh last spring on uh you know the multiplier effect of investment in infrastructure what it means for a more efficient more competitive business for the country nationally and internationally what it means for people in terms of daily lives not being wasted stuck in traffic and commutes and broken down transit systems uh and uh you know that's we're also going to need a bigger workforce so we're going to be reaching out into communities that have been left behind that includes urban communities for sure uh communities of color it also involves rural areas around the country like in rural parts of my district which are which are suffering and give them the opportunities to participate in rebuilding the system with the training they need uh with good federal davis bacon wage jobs so all in all uh this is a total home run i know we can do it in the house uh you know the d.o.t is looking at my invest act to suggest whatever amendments they might like their other departments are looking at other sections of moving forward uh some things are new those are those are being worked on by by various committees including mine and we have an ambitious timeline for the house uh i was going to do it in early may but we're going to do member directed individual projects and we're waiting for comments from the administration so we're going to delay till later in may but we're going to do it may and the hope is to move the whole package through the house uh before the fourth of july like we did last year when i took the bill to the floor i think on the second or first and we finished on the third and then then we deal with the senate which is obviously a little more difficult so there we are well thank you chairman defazio we appreciate uh your uh comments so much and i guess i'll reiterate and thank you that this is a um an incredible plan to create equity make our uh planet and our worlds uh greener bring us together and i think that's an important point on i think all of the sum total of peter's comments were that this is going to bring uh all forms of transportation together um and get people back on transit so excited to hear about all of this you know each of us is here today to highlight uh parts of the plan and what it would mean for communities and organizations and transportation systems we represent but for decades our nation has been putting modernizing on the back burner right um and now it's on the front burner in fact it's in front of the stove i'm pretty sure so this has all resulted in incomplete and infrastructure projects broken roads eliminated bus routes transportation deserts which i see in my own community frequently in far too many communities across the country last week president biden announced a once in a century i'm going to say that again once in a century capital investment to put our country on the right track to build back our roads and local transportation systems that means all kinds of good things affordable accessible reliable transportation for all communities and all residents not just some because we have to remember that at the heart of this plan is equity whether it's advancing racial equity by providing good-paying union jobs to under-served communities or ending transportation deserts by extending our reach through projects like the red line extension right here in chicago area or improving accessibility through investments in initiatives like the cta's asap initiative which would is dedicated to ensuring 100 percent accessibility at all 145 l stations throughout our region or by advancing environmental justice through investments in green clean infrastructure projects and energy efficient transportation you know one great example is the city's initiative to create an all-electric bus fleet by 2040. very excited about that investing in transportation infrastructure is an investment in all of our communities and residents and we will pay back handsomely through this plan we have the opportunity to not only ensure easy access to transit for working families and at-risk families but also to invest and build affordable housing this is a big deal and this is where it gets very intersectional in nature which makes it a a multi-front problem solver which i can deeply appreciate in my region and and what's best is that this development ensures these communities will grow but doesn't displace residents which i think is critical and you know i'd like to point to one right in the center of my district it's called the leclaire quartz chicago southwest side redevelopment that type of transit oriented uh development is what we can replicate in communities across the state and the nation let's use that great model and make it explosive and infectious everywhere and again i'll just say one more time when we can make it intersectional and solve multiple problems and create equity it is a win-win-win and whether we're talking about reliable transportation safe water affordable housing healthy schools clean electricity and broadband for all equity is at the heart of amer this american jobs plan let's not only create more efficient roads and railways but also much needed economic development with good-paying jobs for everyone in every neighborhood the american rescue plan provided our transit systems with a lifeline to keep them alive now let's let them thrive let's do it this once in a century capital investment in our nation's infrastructure is ready to go so all we have to do is go get this done and i'm excited to work with all my colleagues here to make that happen today we have the pleasure of having deputy governor mitchell with us metro sia metro ceo jim durwinsky cta president darvell carter chicago department of transportation executive gia biaggi afl cio president tim dre and will county executive jennifer bertino talent but first i'd like to introduce my neighbor to the east um the wonderful representative chewie garcia should we go ahead and take it away oh thank you so much uh congresswoman newman for pulling this critical and timely event together it's great to have you on the tni committee and i look forward to working together to get chicago's a fair share of federal investments for the region we need more people on the committee who understand that the gold coast is the best coast and thank you chairman defazio for all the work that you put in last session in making hr2 such a bold and progressive bill and for the work you did to secure critical transit funding in the american rescue plan i was thrilled to see transit agencies like the cta receive the resources that they need it took a lot of effort but it was well worth the fight as america transportation hub chicago keeps america's freight moving and the workers keep trains moving relying on our public transit systems to keep our city moving as well but when the pandemic hit our economy came to a screeching halt it devastated our airports transit systems and our lives but it did give us pause to reassess the reality is that the disrepair of our transportation systems goes beyond crumbling roads and bridges access to jobs services health care and schools have been limited by poor planning and at times intentional discrimination for decades for too long public transportation and rail systems have been underfunded highways and roadways were used to carve up black and latino neighborhoods with the american rescue plan we can finally put people back to work get our trains and airports moving again and most importantly it's just the first step we have a historic opportunity to actually build back better not just to get back to where we were but to undo the harm and past policies and what they've inflicted on marginalized communities i know that with all of us working together we will get chicago the funding it needs and get people back to work in construction jobs and good paying union jobs so thank you marie for inviting me to speak and thank you chairman defazio for taking the time to learn a bit more about the best city in the country thanks again okay next we'll go to deputy governor christian mitchell and then just uh for awareness for all the reporters watching we'll have a q a at the end and if you have a question you can raise your hand thanks all right well thank you everyone for having me this morning my name is christian mitchell i'm a deputy governor for governor pritzker and infrastructure is one of my areas of focus i want to start by thanking congresswoman newman and congressman garcia and chairman defazio for inviting me to speak and most importantly for the great work that you all have done on the american rescue plan which gave much needed a much-needed lifeline to our transportation systems our transit systems as well as the corona virus relief package which provided 350 million dollars in critical investment in the department of transportation for otherwise revenue we would have lost from depleted motor fuel tax revenue so on behalf of a grateful state and a grateful governor thank you infrastructure is a top priority for governor pritzker after years of neglect the investment in the historic rebuild illinois capital program is updating our state's aging railways roads bridges and freshwater transportation assets which is the largest infrastructure investment we've made in a generation our vertical infrastructure has also been improved by this plan and in fiscal year 2020 alone the governor's investment improved 1700 miles of highway and over 120 bridges having said that there is still so much more work to do here in the state of illinois right now we've got 8 000 miles of roadway that is either in need status right now or an accrual status which basically means it's in the yellow and is on its way to needing repair we've got about at least 20 billion square miles of of uh bridges that still need updates and we have done self-help here in illinois we have provided revenue in an ongoing way but additional monies could help accelerate the work the american jobs plan is the potential to accelerate that process by literal years to reinforce illinois as the country's transportation hub all while creating thousands of good-paying union jobs and creating reliable pathways for people of color and those as congressman garcia so eloquently put it have historically been locked out to get into those good paying jobs but not only do we have this opportunity to invest in our transportation infrastructure we can also invest in the new green economy as as chairman defazio said we can invest in and augment the 70 million dollars we already have put toward transportation electrification in the rebuild illinois plan we can invest in replacing lead pipes to make sure that our kids are as safe as they possibly can be and make other critical investments in a clean energy future and do all of that through an equity lens so governor pritzker and the administration are very excited to work with all of you and all of our partners in moving this forward and we look forward to advocating with our delegation to get the best and most we can for the state of illinois so thanks for having me here today okay next we'll go to metra ceo jim darwinski thank you thank you very much my name is jim dewinski metro ceo and executive director i'd like to thank congresswoman newman for this opportunity to speak and pulling together this roundtable your leadership uh in the few months that you've been in congress has been very impressive you've really hit the ground running almost as fast as our locomotives run and chairman defazio it's great seeing you again i want to thank you for your continued leadership on support of hr2 and the 500 billion dollar transformational surface transportation authorization uh you congress women garcia excuse me congressman garcia congresswoman newman your support here in illinois has been so strong and without that we wouldn't be anywhere as you know um metra has a significant loss of ridership during the covid pandemic and without your support and stimulus here we would not be able to be where we sit today we sit in a position right now where we can actually start looking at the future traditionally we're moving about 300 000 riders a day we're currently just now under 30 000. that's a very small number but we sit at the point with vaccinations coming out that ridership has been slowly increasing ever since the second week of january and i have great hopes throughout the course of this summer we're going to start to see brand new ridership patterns exist but we can't stop just planning for the future because at some point when that ridership returns what does that mean well chairman defazio it's great to hear you say that only bridges should last 60 years 400 of metres 800 bridges are well over a century year old right now as i said today if we replace 10 bridges a year for the next 40 years we're only going to be at the point in 2067 where we've only caught up to what is already a central today the infrastructure that was put into this great city was put here a long time ago one of the other things to look at as we start looking at ways to reinvest in the region is looking at rail grade crossings and furthering the amount of money available to make our our streets safer and also rail the railgrade crossings to decongest where these large freight trains are moving in this dense urban area where we can actually get them into their yard so they can get off the way and and stop blocking intersections um i look forward to looking at battery powered locomotives or hydrogen powered locomotives we plan on putting out an rfp here within the next two weeks for those and start retiring some of our 1977 locomotives we certainly know how to make things last here on the railroad it also means um tackling the social um problems that we've been trying to deal with um and just like president carter we have a goal to take our non-ada stations and bring them into ada compliance we just put in an order for 200 new cars that's going to replace our non-compliant ada cars i also would like to applaud you for the you know the transit um interest that you both you've all three have had you you've really stepped forward and made it well known out there that uh you know the numbers that you're putting forward are just once in a lifetime like you said and so once in a lifetime or once in a hundred years i can certainly tell you we can certainly start using some of that money to work on our bridges metro stands ready today to make a difference for our future in the region and once again i want to applaud you for your commitment to transit to infrastructure and making our region and this nation as strong as it can ever be thank you okay next we'll go to cta president carter wow this has been quite an introduction um uh thank you congresswoman newman uh congressman garcia and chairman defazio uh for your leadership and transportation and for in particular the the special interest you have shown in cta it has been phenomenal uh we are all the better uh as a result of it uh it is certainly just my distinct pleasure to be with you today along with my fellow transportation and trans leaders uh though when the pandemic hit chicago cta saw its ridership drop by almost 80 percent from 1.5 million riders a day to 400 000 and a revenue loss of almost 1 million per day there is no question in my mind without the support of congress and all of you as leaders and the pastor of the emergency relief legislation like the american rescue plan cta would not have been able to meet the daily needs of hundreds of thousands of his customers many of whom are essential workers who rely on cj to get to their jobs and other important destinations and it's interesting that in the same way that the american rescue plan provided critical funding to allow cj to continue to provide essential services i am equally excited about a robust infrastructure plan that would allow cta to attain the strong foundation needed to provide that service the prospect of a new major infrastructure package as proposed in the president's american jobs plan and in hr2 the moving forward act is exactly the kind of roadmap that our industry needs public transportation in chicago region has long seen inadequate investments in infrastructure as my colleague mr dewensky pointed out in fact cta currently faces a 13 billion dollar backlog in capital needs just to get to a state of good repair some of our rail stations are over a century old and haven't seen significant investment in years and as a result although more than 70 of our rail stations are accessible to persons with disabilities more than 40 stations are not and as congresswoman newman pointed out that is a critical issue that i have committed myself to addressing in fact in 2018 cj announced a plan to address that deficiency over the next 20 years and we've already begun working towards that goal but funding is absolutely key to making this plan become a reality sooner rather than later especially for our mobility limited customers additionally as congresswoman newman pointed out we are also working towards a commitment to make cta green transportation by transitioning our entire bus fleet to an all-electric vehicle fleet by 2040. we've taken the first steps by introducing the first of our newest generation of electric buses just last week but again federal funding is crucial to meeting this goal there is no question that public transit must play a leading role in our region's return to the new normal but in order to welcome riders back we need to provide the best service possible and that starts with having the funding necessary to invest in modern infrastructure like everyone participating in today's event i'm very excited about the prospect of finally being able to address so many long neglected needs and like everyone here i'm fully committed to making prudent investments that will benefit all of this region and will build a strong foundation for public transit's future thank you okay next we'll go to c dot commissioner um biasi thank you so much for having me here today thank you chairman defazio congresswoman newman congressman garcia it's a pleasure to be with you here today along with my colleagues and other state and local partners to talk about the critical need for investments in our transportation system as we've heard today right the unprecedented challenges the last year um you know it's so incredibly encouraging right now to see new leadership and this leadership out of the illinois delegation in particular that prioritizes not only helping cities and states recover from covet 19 but committed to investing in infrastructure that will build toward a more just and prosperous future and the president's american rescue plan was that great first step right putting our city and our country on that path to recovery from the pandemic and helping all of us maintain those vital services and it was inspiring last week to hear president biden spell out some of the details of that american jobs plan so we've talked chicago of course is a national transportation hub so the entire country benefits from robust investments in chicago's transportation infrastructure along with our region and our city so this means roads and rails but it means bridges and bikeways traffic signals and sidewalks and everything in between and the american jobs plan living up to that promise it'll have that exponential impact that we've been talking about in terms of jobs in terms of climate change clean energy and overall equity so we strongly support the president's plan to increase investments and all those acronyms that are the funding programs that we care so much about surface transportation program stp congestion mitigation cmac tap build and the infra program those are all absolutely critical and ready for fun funding that can be delivered and really hit the streets in chicago so these investments we think and this bill will really push forward our work to prioritize walking and biking as well as reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and improving our public way to promote neighborhood revitalization and i should add we're very encouraged by the safe streets for all program that will increase funding dedicated to vision zero our traffic safety efforts that aim to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries from traffic crashes a huge investment in the quality of life of our neighborhoods and a alignment with mayor lightfoot's program in best south and west to address those historic inequities that we've seen writ large across the city generationally in our own city and in so many others so a couple of things that are absolutely critical we are looking forward to support to protect our lakefront shoreline we talked about our coastline a little bit today it's one of our greatest assets and it's threatened by the rising lake levels that come from climate change and so we've done work along with the state and locally to try to lead the way on infrastructure investments but as you've heard from anyone it's kind of a splash in the bucket we really need the help to push forward to chip away at those billions of dollars of infrastructure need that we all have so we are very excited to be here today in this conversation and look forward to making those long-term uh hundred-year kinds of investments that will benefit many generations to come so thank you so much for for having us here today okay before we get to our last two speakers i just want to remind any press that are watching that if they have questions to use the raised hand feature and will unmute you after all the remarks are finished next we'll go to afl-cio illinois president tray thank you congresswoman newman congressman garcia chairman defazio for the invitation to speak today my name is tim dre and i have the privilege of being the president of the illinois afl-cio it is obvious to us that the economic policies of cutting our way to prosperity is not working working families are actually working harder and getting less and there is no better economic engine investing in our local state and national infrastructure it boosts the economy with good paying union jobs and boost commerce by creating and improving the critical infrastructure that is the lifeblood of a healthy and vibrant business community illinois working families from all of our communities in illinois will benefit greatly with the investments in our airports rail transit and highway systems to retain and restore their world-class status president biden's american jobs plan is a monumental effort to not only rebuild our nation's infrastructure but also rebuild a prosperous middle class in this country working men and women in illinois applied the efforts of congressman newman congressman congresswoman newman congress congressman garcia and the entire illinois congressional delegation for ensuring working men and women have a seat at the table to collectively work together to restore our economy and strengthen the middle class and in closing i just want to tell you the working men and women of illinois afl-cio we are ready to roll up our slaves to build back better thank you very much and then we'll go to our last speaker will county executive bertino good afternoon and thank you for allowing will county to uh join you today to the previously approved federal support small businesses non-profits municipalities schools food sales were all provided a lifeline as we weathered through the early months of the pandemic but the economic and social fallout from the pandemic continues and while the vaccine provides the light at the end of the tunnel devastation caused by this pandemic will continue long after the final vaccine has been distributed what's worth the pandemic has only exasperated in qualities and inequities that exist in our communities and the need for safe and reliable transportation for our residents is more important than ever focusing on our roads bridges and public transportation is a priority for will county the american rescue plan along with a robust infrastructure plan supported by our local federal delegation has reassured our communities we are not being forgotten with a multi-year window for allocating funds the county can be strategic in how it spends these resources leveraging partnerships with state and local governments as well as private businesses as the logistics and shipping hub of the midwest the county's infrastructure needs are great to maintain the regis status as north american street hub the county has a growing need to expand and repair existing major thoroughfares a major infrastructure package will have the added benefit of helping to address the county's growing infrastructure needs as we continue to see millions of square feet logistic projects and create good paying long-term jobs for residents as we'll count in will county and the region continue to come back i want to thank chairman defazio congressman garcia and especially will county delegate congresswoman newman who has been a strong and wonderful advocate for our region thank you for having me okay now we'll take some questions i've got um two hands raised already the first is gonna be lynn sweet lynn i'm gonna unmute you now hi everyone thank you for doing the call i appreciate it so my questions are for uh congressman garcia and congressman newman and i'll give you the three questions together and don't mute me afterwards in case there's a follow-up please so one uh have you filed your list yet when will you file it how are you going to decide the projects are you looking for a unified list from the state or what what is the allocation that you think each member will have can it be pulled and then what are the prospects of getting even oh chairman if you're on this that's great chairman defazio what is the allocation for each member i've heard there's a range between 15 and 20 perhaps you could clarify and we have five republicans from illinois including one who is a ranking member of the transportation committee what's the chance of getting him on board with this proposal lynn i actually think chairman defazio left so i'll uh answer some of the questions that you shared and i know you will keep me accountable and honest if i do not answer every one of them so come back at me so uh starting with uh projects so um we were given um a set of criteria by which to assess um i know that so okay okay so just tell me what's going to be on the list and how when you're going to submit it and are you looking for a unified list because or or is everyone in the district you know the different districts just going to do it and then you figure it out later are you and then again the senators i mean that's another are they going to be consulted because eventually you'll need them so right there and there are others on the call just tell me about i know all the backstory to this what's okay what are you gonna do on the list so um we are generating lists right now and i'm sure chewie is generating his we've had some brief conversations across the delegation the goal is at some point to regionalize and optimize but we are in the the list building this is literally grassroots line so think about community-based organizations and community leaders saying what are your priorities so the things that are in the most disrespect disrepair um get get the attention that they need forget it whatever how you make the sauce i did so you're not looking in the beginning for a unified list you'll do district by district uh what are you what is your understanding on the allocation on the allocation there's been no decisions made that's what we know for sure we are building the list first it's what's what's the tentative what's the ballpark there's no ballpark line yet you can call uh chairman defazio that has not been ascertained yet and for all the things that people want this is great uh but what we don't have a republican and equal you have a ranking republican on the committee uh so what are the prospects of getting one of the five at least illinois republicans on this bill because you can only lose three democrats in the house well i would think every republican would want to be on this bill this is a bill that's going to bring jobs just hundreds and thousands of jobs to illinois so i would think they'd all want to be honest what have you done what are the prospects i'm not arguing that it's good bill or what just got to get to 219. so yeah we we already look on tni and i think chairman defazio would have and so would that we've had lots of discussions across the aisle and i think that there's um there's a large uh chunk of both the surface transportation act on hr2 as well as um in the american jobs program um there's a lot of agreement so this notion that there's no agreement is actually incorrect okay so bust miller davis lahood kenzinger who will be with you good question and i i've not had a direct conversation in the last week with any of them so did you talk to these guys at all we did when we were in town yeah absolutely we did okay thank you thank you then uh since you asked uh both of us um i thought the congresswoman should go first um the um earmarks uh community funded projects um are open uh we've announced it we're encouraging uh groups in throughout my district to come forward with their proposals we want to see the full spectrum of ideas that they have and we've established a deadline for uh submission of april 19th on the one hand uh on the other hand uh i'm open completely open to collaboration uh on projects that would be beneficial and strategic to the region uh possibly to the state as well i've had some early conversations with rodney davis and we have agreed to continue to talk as this gels a little further it's still very early in the process and as marie has said we haven't been told how much uh we will get only that it will be uh 10 projects per member uh we're also hosting a roundtable with community leaders uh to you know provide more information on the criteria and answer any questions they may have well ten per member but that's kind of crazy if you don't have a price tag one bridge might cost more than nine you know bike trails yeah that's why it's uh kind of premature to you know start thinking about what will the what what is it's not premature because you have a deadline for the list and i know defazio extended it but it is yeah well it's premature for me because we haven't had enough engagement uh to be here thank you thank you thank you okay our next question is from greg hines at cranes greg i'm gonna unmute you now thank you guys can you hear me okay yes yes here's my question um uh big is this program is you can't uh you can't do everything uh even with this amount of money each of you mentioned all kinds of different ideas and projects uh uh ten from each a different member of congress and you didn't even mention some of the bigger stuff like 95th extension uh the cta redline south extension or or the rebuilding lakeshore drive uh could i ask uh in turn that that mr carter commissioner biaggi mr dwinsky and mr mitchell would each of you tell us the top two or three priorities that your particular agency or municipality or government unit has what are you really looking for in this bill what's what's at the top of your list well greg i don't think for c from tj's perspective we haven't really been shy about what we've had at the top of our list um i didn't mention red line extension because i see representative newman already mentioned it for me and the reason she mentioned it is because i talked to her and said that's one of my top priority projects um uh but electrification of our bus system uh completion and acceleration of asap have all been three of the top priorities that cj has been identifying uh in all of our conversations with our elected officials and uh you know we also have worked really closely with cdot and the city to make sure that there are some opportunities we can leverage we have heard from all of our representatives about the importance of of looking at this from a regional perspective and not just coming in individually with everything that we want and so for example with the city we've been talking about how asap may fit into a broader accessibility uh uh list that the that the commissioner may have around around um uh sidewalks and and and roads and uh certainly with electrification of buses we've talked to the city in the past about bus ways and other things that could be further used to enhance our bus service so i think there's been a cour there's been a conversation both amongst um those of us at the regional level but also with our representatives to understand what they would be looking for with their districts uh to support them and i think the good news from my perspective is that when you have 13 billion dollars on that capital needs i have no shortage of list that i can plug in any any congressional district uh that anybody wants uh to support that and and i think that the conversations we're having now are very fruitful and more importantly i i think that when you start talking about the size of an infrastructure bill the likes of which you know the the congresswoman and congressman have discussed in this call the opportunities to move many more projects forward are going to occur um and while everyone's getting stuck on what the earmark list is going to look like i'm kind of stuck on the bigger picture which is how to get the most money i can to address everything i need to get done uh while the earmarks will be great and i'll be happy to get them i'm even happier about the fact that you know there there's a multi-trillion dollar infrastructure bill that's going to give me many more opportunities to do a whole lot more than even the earmarks will allow me to do going forward thank you and i'll pick up from there um thank you president carter and thanks for the question yeah in the same respect we've been looking regionally where do we have that kind of intersectional approach i think you heard congressman newman talk about that where we can align some of our interests across multiple agencies i think a great example that president carter brought up is ada and just to extend that you know we have over one and a half billion dollars worth of ada ramp and sidewalk accessibility improvements that we need to do we're chipping away a year upon year but this is an incredible moment to say how do you connect that with the asap program with equitable transit oriented development projects all of that that has an exponential impact so we're looking for that kind of a sweet spot and yes there are major systemic improvements our list too can go on uh certainly a long way but we've talked a lot about shoreline protection it's an it's an existential crisis for our shoreline with the rising lake levels with climate shifts and change and we have a lot of work to do we've done we have about eight to nine more miles of the chicago's lakefront to address it's something we've been doing in a long-term partnership with the army corps of engineers but this is the moment to get the work done to get the shovels in the ground and really come up with those adaptive climate changes uh climate change adaptations that you've seen on the south side for example of the city in the past couple of years the tremendous storms the water is actually moving beyond the park land and into private homes and properties absolute crisis and needs a response a magnitude we cannot do alone i think the other i'll just point out a couple others priorities for chicago is our water infrastructure um you know we have a 400 000 lead lines in the city of chicago and water quality is an absolute priority and we are in critical need of this kind of investment to take it on in a systemic way so we're not just chipping away a year upon year but we're doing a major investment and that is an incredible improvement to quality of life across our city and i'll just pick up two more because you asked like as president carter said my list can keep going but certainly investments in the create program which is a very successful partnership all the way from the federal level down to our level that reduces rail conflicts that reduces traffic conflicts between trains that's all about keeping us a huge logistics and transportation hub getting people moving smoothly through the city reducing congestion reducing the costs associated with all of that and then lastly i have to point out we are i mentioned it earlier but to see vision zero called out uh at the federal level at the potential scale to create opportunities for pedestrian safety bike infrastructure and really think about how we are designing in cities for people and neighborhoods in a way not simply moving vehicles but making great places and those are the kinds of priorities that we have uh from chicago's side commissioner is it fair for me to assume that when you talk uh lakefront protection uh that you you're in effect saying yes uh rebuilding north lakeshore drive is a priority because a big part of that is uh is adding additional bumper space along the lakefront yeah i think north lakeshore drive is also another one of those major signature projects that has kind of all the trappings of being a major regional impact and addressing climate as well as mobility improvements across the region so yes thank you yeah greg i'll be brief because you know frankly a lot of what i'm going to say would echo what the president the commissioner just said right so um the year mark list is interesting and i think that insofar as folks are looking at that list again we're going to work with our congressional delegation but looking at it through an equity an impact lens is really going to matter like equity and impact having said that again 8 000 you know miles of roadway that still need to either have need right now or need will have a cruel need fairly shortly again 20 million square feet of bridges that still need repair into a point that commissioner fazio made before he left improving the life of that asset such that we're lowering our long-term maintenance costs and then to the point that president carter made getting to clearing things out of the backlog is going to be most helpful to the state so that's true on the transportation side beyond that a lot of what's been proposed in this american jobs plan is an amplification of some of the stuff that we did here in rebuild illinois investments in broadband infrastructure the state's already invested 420 million that's not enough the federal government investing literally hundreds of billions more will help expand access and economic opportunity yes in in urban areas that need the augmentation but also to rural communities that have small businesses and have connections to agribusiness that will be augmented by that sort of stuff investments in our water infrastructure to the point that commissioner biasi made that is a massive deal when the great lakes are 20 of the world's fresh water so making sure that chicagoans can get access to good water is going to be good for chicago but also good for the entire state and by the way vital for the region's economy going forward and then finally investments in green infrastructure governor pritzker has said often he wants to make this the best place in the world to manufacture or sell an electric vehicle we've got rivien we want to bring more of those jobs here they are the jobs of the future so making sure that they involve people of color involve places in illinois that desperately need the jobs involve president dre's members and making sure that they are good union jobs you add those three things on top of an investment in a backlog of our transportation infrastructure that's a pretty important bill for the people of the state of illinois thank you uh mr uh mr dwinsky yeah i'll make it brief because um deputy governor president and uh commissioner have really kind of said it all um we have giant lists they all hit the same buckets zero emissions locomotives are gonna dramatically improve the environment for every 1500 cars i take off the road that is a huge footprint on congestion and emissions a great crossings as commissioner brought up with the crate program that's it should just grow from there there's so much opportunity there um ada both in our stations and in our cars we have we have a ways to go and we need to continue working on that i touched on the bridges and and the age of the bridges and the fact is we've got to start working on those and then what i didn't touch on earlier was an o'hare express i mean this is something transformational 100 years from now people may be talking about when when we finally built an o'hare express utilizing a current infrastructure that's that's our list thank you okay i don't see um any more questions in the queue uh congresswoman newman if you want to say anything before we all log off um i appreciate everyone all the press joining today thank you well thank you lynn and greg for joining today and thank you to everybody on this call really appreciate all your good thoughts and i'm very excited to work all together and we are going to regionalize this so we have uh we can address equity and jobs uh moving forward so thank you for all your hard work and let's go create this plan have a great day guys

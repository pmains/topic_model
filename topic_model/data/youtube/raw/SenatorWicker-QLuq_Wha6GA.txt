president I Rise this afternoon to call attention to the Mississippi National Guard on the eve of the 60th anniversary of their largest ever deployment we've we've been fortunate since before Mississippi actually became a state to have a strong National Guard dating back actually to 1798. the Mississippi National Guardsmen have served honorably in armed conflicts including the War of 1812 both World Wars the Korean War and the global war on terror they've also been the backbone of disaster relief responding to hurricanes floods and tornadoes but what I want to talk about today is what they did to keep the peace at a time of civil unrest 60 years ago tomorrow September 30 1962. and many of us remember this no doubt uh you you remember this Mr President on September 30 1962 a riot erupted at the University of Mississippi my alma mater as James Meredith arrived on campus James Meredith would become the first African-American student to gain admission at Ole Miss and uh James Meredith is being recognized in Mississippi this week uh as uh as he rightly should be my wife Gail uh attended uh a very impressive event last night on the campus of the University of Mississippi at our beautiful Gertrude Ford Center with Mr Meredith uh present we're glad he's still with us and he was rightly uh recognized today for the first time we have an opportunity to uh finally recognize those young mississippians and Young Americans who were called up by President Kennedy and maintained the peace and uh and and did their Duty the soldiers arrived in Oxford um on September 30th they came from small towns and Rural communities across Mississippi and like Mr Meredith some of them are still with us as we Mark the 60th anniversary of that Ole Miss Riot it is right that today we honor the citizen soldiers who stood In Harm's Way who answered the call of their president to to protect life and property it was clear even before the violence erupted that many agitators a vast number of them from out of state were going to cause trouble there was a retired General in Texas named Edwin Walker he issued a radio call from Texas suggesting that ten thousand people from across the region descend on the Ole Miss campus um in response our Mississippi National Guard prepared for the worst they responded to President Kennedy's call in the great tradition of our military dating back to the time of George Washington these civilian leadership gave an order and our military saluted and did their Duty as nightville the crowds grew increasingly violent and the need for reinforcements became dire at the command of Mississippi Brigadier General Charles Billingsley the National Guard dispatched two battle groups from the 155th red Infantry Regiment and one group from the 108th armored Cavalry Regiment a total of three thousand eighty six men based out of Laurel Amery and Tupelo Mississippi these young soldiers immediately met resistance as they arrived on campus rioters actually assaulted General Billingsley along with his Deputy General John Corley and his aide Captain Harold Lyon and set their vehicle on fire these three soldiers managed to escape by crawling 200 yards to the lyceum building our Administration Building while under gunfire hours later additional troops were called in from Pontotoc Water Valley to Quail rioters who had surrounded the lyceum by morning some 25 000 service members had arrived to restore order now tragically there were two fatalities during this 15-hour Riot but there could have been a lot more dozens more will ruined were wounded including 40 of the soldiers as a precaution the National Guard troops were kept in place for several weeks and by the end of their deployment more than 30 000 soldiers had been mobilized these citizen soldiers did their Duty and following the orders of their commander-in-chief they prevented the crisis from becoming much worse this Riot was an ugly chapter in our history Mr President but it was one of the Mississippi National Guards Finest Hours and as the decades have proceeded and we've recognized the the other people who were involved this is the first time that the Senate will have had an opportunity to recognize the Young Americans who came and restored order so my colleague Senator Cindy Hyde Smith and I have joined to introduce a resolution honoring the Mississippi National Guard for their heroic actions and designating tomorrow September 30th 2022 as Mississippi National Guard recognition day the following day in Mississippi the University of Mississippi has designated it as James Meredith recognition day and so Mr President at this time I asked unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of esrez 809 which is at the desk political report Senate resolution 809 designating September 30th 2022 as Mississippi National Guard recognition day is their objection to proceeding to the measure without objection the Senate will proceed and now Mr President I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to the Preamble be agreed to and that the Motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate without objection thank you Mr President

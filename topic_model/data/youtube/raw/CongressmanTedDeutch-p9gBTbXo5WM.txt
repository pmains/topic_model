I'd like to quote some of my colleagues from this committee one of them said that the special counsels investigation into whether the Trump campaign assisted in its effort to interfere in the election is actually an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States do you believe that mr. Rosenstein No he said we're at risk of a coup d'etat in this country if we allow an unaccountable person is the Special Counsel unaccountable here no he's not gonna count he went on to say with no oversight is there no oversight at all with the special counsel there is oversight and then he went on to say that if we allow it on a callable person with no over-under to undermine the duly elected president knighted States is pursuing the rule of law undermining the duly elected president of the United States mr. Rosenstein no it is not one of my other colleagues said we've got to clean this town up he talked about firing Mahler one of our former colleagues on this committee accused Muller of having a vendetta against President Trump because he fired James Comey mr. Rosenstein do you believe that he has a vendetta against no president no I do not I I would just conclude that this little walk through this one year in American history makes it impossible to understand how it is that my colleagues on the other side continue to launch attacks not only against reporters against the FBI against the special counsel but they do so to throw dirt on this story to make it try to go away they may want to bury their heads in the sand but mr. chairman I want to make clear that they will not bury the rule of law in the United States of America and I yield back the gentleman's time has expired

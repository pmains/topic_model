who's a member of the health subcommittee the gentlelady from California is recognized for two minutes madam chair I rise in opposition to this misguided legislation while the house leadership claims that this week is all about jobs the discussion of this bill on the House floor shows their true colors just like when they almost shut down the government over Planned Parenthood today we once again witness how ideological campaign promises Trump needed actions on jobs and the economy it's been said before and I'll say it again HR 358 does not create a single job not one instead is unprecedented assault on the rights of women and families everywhere to make important life decisions this bill does a lot it limits the choices of women and families to purchase health insurance with their own dollars it removes vital protections to ensure that a pregnant woman with a life-threatening condition can get life-saving care and circumvent state laws that ensure women have access to preventive services screenings and birth control but what this bill doesn't do is trust our nation's women and families to make their own healthcare choices this is unacceptable some have claimed that the Affordable Care Act has led to taxpayer funded abortions it is false others have claimed that this bill is nothing but the Stupak language that divided our chamber last year I was involved in every debate over the Stupak amendment in the house and madam chair I can tell you this is way beyond that misguided amendment so I urge my colleagues to abandon this divisive effort put the brakes on this extreme legislation and let us turn our focus to the issue of job creation to help the American people I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman reserves the gentleman from Pennsylvania madam Speaker

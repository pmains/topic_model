on the phone with us this morning first district congressman tracy man good morning congressman good morning nick how are you this morning i'm good so far so the big news out of washington is that they say there's a deal on gun control legislation on the senate side do you know anything about what that looks like or do you do you not get to really be a part of the negotiations once it gets over there well you know it brought up on the outside last week got a lot of concerns about it nick i just think we cannot go and take people's second amendment rights away you know for law-abiding citizens who've done nothing wrong there are also some red flag laws and some other things in that legislation that i and the things madrid people the big first did not uh agree with so i put a note to the package last week now um a handful of negotiators are on the senate side saying they've come up with the framework you know until you see the text and really know what's in it it's really hard to uh to comment either way though i'll certainly be voting against it if it's something that increases red flag laws or takes away second amendment rights of law-abiding citizens and the bottom line is as long as it's any different from what passed it has to come back to you guys right that's correct so it would have to um you know the senate will have to work it often takes them longer just how their their rules and floor time is set up especially what they do with that this week and that gets turned into a bill and is considered and then we'll see if he gets kicked back to uh to the house side of the legislature here next week or sometime later this summer sure so there have been a lot of things you've been working on earlier this month though you and over 100 of your colleagues sent a letter to the sec talking about a new proposed rule that could really hurt ag producers can you explain that a bit yeah basically the fcc the security exchange commission has a rule that they're putting forward that would require all companies agriculture included to report on their impact of their industry or their particular business to the climate to climate change this is kind of in line or similar to esg stores that people are following that and i'll tell you nick this would be devastating for agriculture it would add a lot of burns a lot of red tape a lot more it makes it harder for ag producers to do what they do best and that's feed fuel and uh and close the world so i mean i guess this is part of what you all in congress argue about to a certain degree is that sometimes the authority that you all should have ends up going to some administrative rule of some kind whether it be the usda or the sec or the epa or any of the rest of the alphabet soup that that you and i know what they mean but listeners might not um if there really does need to be changes and we can argue whether or not there does shouldn't isn't that something congress ought to deal with i wholeheartedly agree and it's really important people understand that some of these policies and these things being pushed forward by the administration it's not coming through or even being considered by certainly has not been passed by congress um it's these regulatory agencies that are doing what they're doing nick it's your point i feel like the last really couple of decades we've seen the powers of the executive branch increase and the powers of the legislature of congress decrease and i believe the founding fathers intended the opposite they intended for a relatively weak executive branch but a very strong congress legislative branch that was much more directly uh you know accountable to the people but we've seen reverse of that the last couple of decades and then it's not a good thing for the country in my view well and that it becomes even more difficult when you represent the type of district that you do tracy which is generally speaking rural but generally speaking again the people that get up into these administrative agencies uh end up being people from the urban side whether it is a a donald trump or a joe biden or whomever it might be and then just because that's where the that's where the votes are and that's where people then think the expertise is so how do you deal with trying to get the interests of rural america into the minds of these regulators if it isn't going to come back to congress yeah great question someone we're working on thinking about um pushing into every day you know uh my job is to advocate for agriculture and our conservative kansas values which in many you know respects have been lost in other parts of the country so how do we do that a whole host of things just putting forth the right legislation it's also providing oversight to these through the bureaucracy uh and to these regulations that are going into place and speaking out against them it's finding them out identifying them pushing back against them it's holding hearing there's a whole host of things that we're constantly doing to prevent what you're describing from occurring or continue to occur and trying to decrease them from occurring as much as they are tracy heard on the news this morning that the national gas price average has eclipsed five dollars a gallon i believe triple a said it was 5.01 i know there's not a lot that congress can do to raise or lower that just because of markets but how does it impact the industries and the people that you serve it seems like it's a double-edged sword for agriculture because uh input costs get so high but also commodity prices are going up as well because of other overseas stuff what do you see on balance yeah well on balance i think we ought to realize how we got where we got and that's this war on fossil fuel is going to result in less supply uh when demand doesn't change then you have upper pressure on prices so this is a direct result of this war this non-physical war on fossil fuel and really liquid fuel uh you know the the answers below our feed is growing in our fields towards what we need to do to get out of this now uh to your point i mean dramatically increases the the price feel free to the pump um which is hard for folks it also is really bad for agriculture you know we are seeing a farm input price we're seeing the price of fertilizer nick which is many times based on fossil fuel um increased 300 400 percent so yeah yeah commodity prices are are very high right now but when you quadruple the price of fertilizer and other inputs it's all about the margin and what you actually take home and we're putting our bag producers the best in the world in a really bad spot right now so i mean i guess what what can people do is there anything to to say okay we want other than other than reducing usage is there anything at all that we can that we can do to to let you know of ways to advocate on the margins for this things like the rfs which i know they've been working on i don't i don't know what's the what's the policy implication here yeah well a lot of things that can be done i think for folks to make their voice heard to all their elected uh folks in office in kansas but also around the country is incredibly important um you know this is a lot of in a large degree this is a result of the policy choices that have been made we need to make it easier for our oil and gas producers to drill new wealth we need to do away with these bogus and horrible esg scores uh that make it hard for our fossil fuel you know our domestic or our independent oil and gas producers to oftentimes to access credit we need to increase ethanol production uh we need to change the regulation so that's easier to do and that can be sold there's no reason we're not doing e15 year round um there's a whole host of things that we do we need to finish the keystone xl pipeline um you know that would bring low-cost crude into our country from canada uh president biden walked away from it there's a lot of things nick that we can do should do not doing those is what put us in this bad spot that we're currently in how much of this though is ultimately the administration's decision to do or not do um either because congress has ceded that authority to them like we talked about earlier in the conversation through these regulatory agencies or simply because they're stretching their hands out a little bit further and not being pushed back against yeah well we are pushing back against it as best we can administration though doesn't it hasn't fully acknowledged how much they've exacerbated and a large degree caused or inflamed this problem and and they need to you know makes no sense nick president biden comes into office and immediately kills the keystone xl pipeline um bringing in low cod low-cost crude from canada um or our ally neighborhoods north meanwhile we send money and support finishing the north stream two pipeline taking oil from russia uh to europe which strengthens and emboldens putin you know this is 180 degrees opposite of what we ought to be doing talk about the farm bill process where are we since the last time we talked yep so uh you know the current farm bill these are typically five-year bills the one we're currently under expires next september so september of 2023 so we're about 16 months away from that and the ag committee you know is starting to talk about it i've been going to the floor every week in fact i'll do it again this week i believe going to the floor and giving what i call the farmville impact series talking to other members and really trying to raise the profile of this farm bill to make sure that we get it right you know with the committee i've been very frustrated with the leadership of the committee has not had on the house side has not had hearings and i've been out listening to people nearly to the extent that that needs to be this needs to be in a producer-centric farm bill to make sure it works for rural america um we've heard rumblings but i don't know how serious this is that uh that the usda may try to tie school lunch funding which is at least tangentially related to the farm bill i'm not sure if it's a direct part of it to making sure that policies are lgbtq friendly in schools to whatever degree you can what what do you know about that is that a serious threat or a serious thought in policy change what what's the what have you heard yep so something we're following very closely i um so far it's just been an article in a press release uh when i saw that um infuriating and so right now in our team we are watching very closely next step is the administration usda would provide um what right what's called a rule that would determine how this would potentially roll out and then from there we we will work to fight against it and make sure that it doesn't happen we can do it legislatively or a host of other ways given the timing nick you know we're already mid-june likely we would be looking at not this but the next school year so uh you know going to a pack next summer it seems that's kind of reading the tea leaves but something we are i'm very concerned about watching very very closely and we're ready to penalton and push back in a very aggressive way if the administration tries to do this all right and again is there any relation between the between that part of what the usda does and the farm bill is there any way you could put something in that bill especially if republicans get control back of the house uh yeah most certainly uh you know in the farm bill you know usda and ag policy overseas food nutrition programs school lunches various things so absolutely those things are are connected and potentially could be tied together in this year's negotiation for the farm bill

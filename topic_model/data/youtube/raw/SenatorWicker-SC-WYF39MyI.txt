joining me now is Republican senator Roger wicker of Mississippi senator thanks so much for joining us I have to start with the words just written by your border colleague the Republican senator from the state of Tennessee bob corker who called the president and utterly untruthful president is President Trump a liar senator well you know I don't think these comments by senator corker are helpful at all the other thing that he said this morning was that the luncheon meeting was going to be nothing more than a photo-op I actually expect it to be quite substantive we had a good victory last week we are likely to have a very positive step over in the house to this week when they pass the budget that the Senate has already passed and so I view it as a coming together in terms of our plans to actually fill in the details and get the tax cut actually passed by both houses and sent to the President's desk why I would I would take issue with Senator corker in that respect also this this should be a lot more than a photo-op today yeah it's an awkward coming together with senator corker calling the president untruthful President Trump saying the senator corker couldn't get elected dog catcher as I said if it the idea is to come together that's a tough place to start but on the substance of this also Republican congressman Charlie dent said of the president that he can shift on a dime on policy matters and he has many unformed policy positions we have to worry about him shifting position so I ask you senator wicker do you know exactly where the president stands on the details of these tax cuts on the details of the tax cuts I think it's important that we not negotiate the details in public through the media but but I think that the the the bones the outline of the tax cuts are there we want to cut the corporate rate because we want to be competitive internationally Europe corporate tax rates about eighteen and a half Asia about twenty percent so we need to get competitive in terms of our job creators and then we need to give the American middle-class taxpayers a little jingle in their pockets and more take-home pay so the outlines are there and we will start talking about details I think with the president today for instance do you know whether or not the president would support keeping a thirty nine percent tax rate on people making more than a million dollars a year and these are those details this is the actual tax cut do you know whether he supports that I don't know that and I'll tell you what I'm gonna decline to negotiate details of the tax cut through the media I think they'll be done I think we'll have a big step toward that today I'm sitting with that with the the luncheon with the president I think it's going to be largely positive ninety-nine point nine percent positive and constructive and I think it's going to get us closer to the to the point we all want to want to have which is a tax bill on the President's desk by Thanksgiving that's ambitious we wish you the best of luck on that and we'll talk to you again after perhaps this lunch to get a sense of what was discussed and I can ask you one more purely political question senator that has to deal with your own re-election race how do you feel about Steve Bennett well I listen I'm going to depend on the people of the state of Mississippi I've been elected a number of times in the first congressional district and twice statewide I'm running hard I expect it to be a competitive race and my wife and my family an hour are prepared to work hard and right now we think we're in a good position to win and it doesn't bug me to say it it doesn't bug you that Steve Bannon wants you to lose well you know I don't think I'm ever going to get a unanimous vote but I'm gonna run on my accomplishments for the state of Mississippi which are lengthy and also happy to be ranked first in the Senate in support of the President Trump at this point with ninety-six percent support of the president's positions in terms of our votes so I'm willing in one of my record and nothing will be fine senator if I can ask you to stay with us for just one moment because you're part of the Armed Services Committee we want to ask you about knees yeah but first I'm gonna get our viewers a bit of an update on some of the developments there this morning really new details in the deadly attack on the US troops in Asia are the Pentagon revising its timeline vali transparency Michelle Kosinski is live in Washington with more Michelle hi Jon right so we had the chairman of the Joint Chiefs obviously feeling like he needed to come out and answer questions in fact making a point to take all of the questions and repeatedly saying that the public is owed more information still there were so many questions that he could not answer and some basic ones - like where exactly were these troops when they started taking fire were they wearing body armor we're now three weeks from when this happened America's top General providing some answers but not many detailing a revised timeline of the ambush and Nazaire that killed four American troops we owe you more information more importantly we owe the families that have fallen more information October 3rd 12 members of a US Special Operations Task Force leave the capital of new share with 30 Nigerian troops their goal a reconnaissance mission in a village about 53 miles north the assessment by our leaders on the ground at that time was that contact with the enemy was unlikely the next day on their way back to the capital mid-morning they came under fire by around 50 local fighters with ties to Isis carrying small arms machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades the Special Forces team engaged in a firefight for about an hour before requesting help within minutes a US drone was overhead jets were scrambled but took another hour to arrive to the remote location I don't know that they thought they needed support prior to that time I don't know how this attack unfolded I don't know what their initial assessment was of what they were confronted with the French did not drop bombs US officials said Friday the pilots had the authority but could not readily identify enemy forces and did not want to risk hitting us or Nigerian allies it was evening by the time the French could evacuate the injured and bodies of the Dead Americans but it remains unclear how sergeant Lee David Johnson became separated from the group and why it took two days to locate his body about a mile away did the mission of US forces change during the operation did our forces have adequate intelligence equipment and training was there pre mission assessment of the threat in the area accurate some of the details to come out were surprising for example this was not a thirty minute or so firefight this was several awful hours starting in mid morning and not ending until the evening John alright Michelle Kosinski thanks so much for that report back with me now senator Roger wicker of Mississippi who serves in the Armed Services Committee and Senator I simply want to ask you we heard Michelle's report you're gonna get a classified briefing as a member of the Armed Services Committee as you sit here today what's the number one question you have on this deadly ambush in the air well I agree with general Dunford and I think general Dunford is certainly the right man for this position the American people need more information the elected representatives of the American people in the Congress need more information and I think we're going to get that you know it does seem at first blush that that these troops may have thought they they had the situation under control and and then only about an hour later realized that it had gotten out of hand so well but we'll find there's no sense of media speculating there will be tough questions and and I think the generals that are and the end the officers that were close by and monitoring the situation have a duty to be forthcoming and I think they will be I think well I think the facts will will come out and the American people can judge senator Roger wicker Mississippi thanks so much for your time sir thank you

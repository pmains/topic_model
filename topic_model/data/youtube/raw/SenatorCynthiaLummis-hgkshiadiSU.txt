good morning thank you Mr chairman good morning to you as well um Mr Goffman uh in 2015 EPA officials working on the ozone transport rule stated that it was not appropriate to extend that rule to Western States due to differences in topography climate while fire prevalence and other factors they even indicated that they would work with Western States on a case-by-case basis with respect to this rule but this Administration has decided to ignore that approach and instead proceed with a one-size-fits-all approach with your new ozone transport rule so what factors have changed between now and 2015 to Warrant this drastic change in approach well thanks for that thanks for that question Senator uh Lumis one of the things that we do is uh continually update our air quality model our air quality modeling and in fact since we met last in May we've done another update along with having met with Governor Gordon and his environmental staff in a meeting that administrator Regan leden that I was able to participate in and since then we've done yet another update in our modeling um one of the results of that is that while when I was here last time we had proposed to disapprove of Wyoming's ozone transport implementation plan when we made final decisions in January we did not finalize that disapproval and it's usually it's the basis of the disapprovals that allows us to move forward or requires us to move forward with Federal implementation plans so in a way the process of air quality modeling changes on a continual basis so that since the last not just since 2015 but since the last time we spoke we've done another update we've had an additional engagement with the state and our proposed disapproval based on previous modeling we're not finalizing at least for Wyoming yeah and and but here's the problem you're finalizing uh Federal implementation plans on on almost all other states and denying State implementation plans and we just assume that you're gonna eventually deny ours and and do a federal implementation plan because that's your MO so for example um Governor Gordon with a couple other Governors sent a letter uh just a few months ago outlining these concerns the governors stated because EPA proposed Federal implementation plans before acting on the state implementation plans EPA eliminated the opportunity for early meaningful substantive and ongoing consultations with the states and this is a the vast majority of this country in terms of geographic areas so how is this concern being addressed by EPA can we just plan in Wyoming on oh we'll wait until December of this year and then we'll go with a fib well that's certainly not not been uh that's not our not our approach and and um as as I said the information we got at least about the air quality updated air quality modeling with respect to Wyoming um you know guided us in a different direction so as I having used one set of information and modeling to propose to disapprove the state implementation plan subsequent modeling that we did in subsequent discussion discussions we had with with Wyoming and the governor and Wyoming environmental Regulators um it took us in a different direction what I'm trying to say senator is we actually do try to follow the data and the modeling and the analysis where it takes us and in this particular case our own updated modeling and dialogue and interaction with the state took us in a different direction from the one we were going in a year ago well State plans need as my colleague from North Dakota said cooperative federalism means State plans should have equal consideration to Federal plans I I have more questions but I'll wait for the next round thank you Mr chairman

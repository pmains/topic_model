joining me now how should she remember Matt Gaetz oh wait Matt so there they don't have any proof or evidence but they're investigating anyway well I guess this is like the Nancy Pelosi version of you've got to read the bill before you can fire you've got a vote on the bill before you can find out what's in it Democrats campaigned promising to be the party of solutions now they're just the party of endless unfocused investigations and what you see from Chairman Nadler is the investigatory equivalent of fishing with dynamite seeking information from 81 different entities I mean just to give you a flavor of how ridiculous it is Jesse they're trying to get documents from the president's former lawyer Don Magan which would clearly be either privileged or subject to an executive privilege and then they're even trying to get information from the content director of the National Enquirer so we may find out why Brad Pitt was at Jennifer Aniston's 40th birthday before we find out whether or not there's any evidence of collusion yeah yeah Trump has one conversation with a member of the media and and that's collusion meanwhile the Democrats talked to the press everyday and leaked and connive it is funny though so he's looking at obstruction of justice the only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting into the White House in my opinion he's looking at public corruption now if they were interested in corruption maybe they would have cared about the Clinton Foundation and abuses of power it's funny because they were really never interested in the IRS targeting the tea party so it looks purely political doesn't horse it is and it is all a lead up to their efforts to destabilize and distract this president what Democrats know is that if Donald Trump has the opportunity to challenge the bureaucracy to end wars to deregulate and then invigorate the American economy he's going to be reelected because the American people are gonna be doing better and so the only hope Democrats have is to try to tweezer through every deal he's ever done every element of his life in hopes that the American people will care more about Donald Trump than they do about their own future I'm betting on people to actually vote their own interests and not follow just the endless saga of endless investigations with no focus no end in sight just a desire to distract you know it's totally hypocritical because Congress takes our money not their money our money and they spend it covering up sexual harassment lawsuits they bribe contractors with it you know they they give it to lobbyists they pay off the Iranians with it it doesn't matter okay and then they want to know what Trump did with a few dollars in the 80s it's his money and so much of what the Democrats have alleged against the president deals with his conduct before he even contemplated a political campaign but you know thus is the nature of Washington today no solutions from Democrats no real legislation to deal with immigration or infrastructure or the issues that they talked about during the campaign instead just more investigations more endless attacks but the good news is the American people the Forgotten men and women of this country they're gonna see through all of this and they're gonna show up in droves to reelect a president that is ending wars and creating more economic opportunity than at any other time in our life Jesse all right congressman thank you very much thank you

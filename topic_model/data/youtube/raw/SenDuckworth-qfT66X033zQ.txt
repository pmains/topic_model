mr. Fisher as AAS a James and I have discussed in the past and and I do want to thank you for being so very approachable and accessible efficient navigation on our inland system is key to a global economic competitiveness I'm sure you agree every time a lock faces an unscheduled closer freight traffic shifts to roadways and rail costs rise for shippers and already razor thin margins for farmers and manufactures are further eroded despite the critical nature of our inland system it always seems to take a backseat to other infrastructure efforts highway projects for example generally enjoy an 80/20 cost share between federal and non-federal sponsors Airport construction projects receive 7525 cost share as do a harbor construction project projects yet lock and dams projects still rely on an outdated 50/50 cost share which exacerbates an eight billion construction backlog mr. Fisher if this committee is able to secure an increase in a federal cost share for inland projects does the Corps have enough projects in the pipeline to accommodate the cost share change we do I think the overall backlog beyond in inland waters is around 100 billion dollars right I don't know what the exact number on in the water is but it's significant that trust fund you referred to is typically depleted each each appropriation cycles so yes there would be projects to get out if this committee and this guy in the Senate Congress were to adjust the cost share Thank You general would you agree with mr. Fisher I do however if you don't increase the top line and then you fence 75% of the current budget you're basically reducing our operating capital by about 25 percent so therefore that means things are not going to get done so if we if we change that cost share I would not want to make sure that we identify to the committee what's the risk you're incurring if the regular top line is the same I think that is a great note of caution and we will take into consideration as we work on the on the change thank you um I want to thank you for secretary James August 16 letter that reinforced his commitment to competing completing a review of the cores urban flooding projects is a quite read language I included in Wardour his letter states that he hopes you if the report completely by the end of the year is that sort of plan I'm sorry the report due at the end of the year uh-huh yeah we're that report any reports were I realized we can be quicker on these things but yes where we're shooting for reports that then in the year as quickly as they can and we'll try to expedite these for the committee thank you thank you mr. chairman

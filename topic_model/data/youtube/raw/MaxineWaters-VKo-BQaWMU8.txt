reference on the issue and has held three town hall events in august but wednesday night he'll speak directly to members of congress and the president's expected to target liberals inside his own party california democrat congresswoman maxine waters is a member of the congressional black caucus which supports a robust public option plan congresswoman waters we keep hearing from the white house that a public option should not be a make or break part of this health care reform debate what's your view well of course i know that the president has supported public option he campaigned on public option he would rather have public option and he's got to understand that he's got the support from a good number of members of congress in the progressive caucus the black caucus the tri caucus and others for a public option he's got to understand that we're there we're going to be with him that he has support from his base for a public option and i think even though he's getting pressure from the insurance companies and those people who do not want any competition that he can move forward and engage in this fight because we can win this fight if the president ends up when the position is saying look we can't do a public option immediately in order to get the votes in the other chamber in the senate we're going to have to do something like a trigger where we give the insurance companies a few more years beyond 2013 to get their house in order and then if they don't then we trigger the public option do you believe that the progressives in the house would go along with that i can't speak for everybody but i can tell you this i don't think any of us are willing to give the insurance companies five more years or more to continue to rip off the american public americans are paying high premium costs they're paying high uh deductibles and high co-payment costs and they're still being denied claims after paying premiums for years once they put the claims in to cover the health care that they need we're not willing to continue that what do you make of what's going on in the other chamber in the senate i mean clearly the votes are there in the house to pass a public option bill right now if you wanted to and you're looking up and seeing so much of what the president's doing to try to get one or two republicans and how much he's trying to reach out for bipartisanship how frustrating is it to you that with all the work your chamber is done you look up at the other chamber and it looks like things just are gummed up well it should be obvious to everybody now that the president is not going to get any real support from republicans on this issue it is not simply about health care they want to stop him they want to bring him down it's political and he's not going to get their support he needs to use the skills of parliamentary procedure in order to do budget reconciliation and move this bill with the majority vote he can do that is there a fear though that um that perhaps i mean the white house expresses that if they try reconciliation because of a variety of reasons and rules it's it's like you can you can essentially make it swiss cheese based on the number of amendments that can be attached in the process um when they say look we may not be able to do it through reconciliation that the idea of sort of jamming this through and having the bill at the end that looks anything remotely like what the house passes would be very difficult how does that make you feel do you believe them do you feel that this is i mean give us your sense of things i don't believe that the president and those who care about the american people and their ability to have credible reform should be deterred from their efforts with the threat that oh maybe it'll get worse maybe you can't do it if if if we fight we can win we need to make a fight on this issue this is extremely important not only to the base of people who supported putting democrats in the majority this is something that we must do because people are suffering the amount of income reports disproportionately paid by those who are out there paying premiums every day every week every year is just unconscionable to not give them the kind of support that they need california democratic congresswoman maxine waters she's a member of the congressional black caucus congresswoman waters thanks so much for coming on we look forward to talking to you later this week and maybe even on wednesday night following the president's speech and thanks again for coming on thank you you're welcome it is a bleak picture for famed photographer annie leibovitz she has until midnight to pay back a 24 million loan or risk losing the rights to her entire life's work leigh bowitz was sued in july for breach of contract she may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection

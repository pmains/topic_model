to the point with congressman bill pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of new jersey's ninth congressional district hello i'm congressman bill pascrell and i would like to welcome you to this latest addition to the point for centuries the passaic river has played a seminal role in our society not just locally but nationally from serving as the lifeline for the 17th century lenape settlements to powering our nation's industrial revolution through the night and the might of the patterson great falls the passaic river has served a critical economic environmental recreational role for generations unfortunately a century of industrialization and development have also left behind toxic sediments including dioxin pcbs heavy metals in addition the growth of residential and industrial development has increased the threat of flooding to local communities causing an estimated six billion dollars in destruction in the past 100 years to help address these formidable challenges several federal proposals have recently been introduced last year the u.s environmental protection agency announced the 1.7 billion proposed cleanup of the lower eight mile stretch of the passaic representing one of the largest ever in the federal superfund program just last week the u.s army corps of engineers announced a three billion proposal to build a series of levees and flood walls from kearney to totoa to help mitigate flooding on the passaic with me today are two outstanding people who helped develop these plans to discuss them in more detail and offer some insight as to what they mean for the passaic river communities judith enk is the regional administrator of region 2 of the u.s environmental protection agency cooperation with state and regional authorities in new jersey new york and puerto rico the u.s virgin islands and eight federally recognized indian nations judith administers federal programs governing air and water pollution industrial discharges and many other federal environmental protective policies joining me a little bit later will be colonel paul owen with the army corps of engineers to discuss their efforts to address flooding in the passaic river basin thank you for being here with us judith it's so great you know when i when i list the contaminants that are in the pacific river and when i see what industrialization you certainly know better than i uh of what what is done to this river which was a great recreational place great commerce place and now has become stagnant although we're beginning to move forward whatever happened to the thought of trying to deregulate the epa or trying to get the ep out of the business what the heck would it be the passaic river without the regulations that were put in place well i think without an epa the passaic river would be even more contaminated than it is today it would probably be on fire and there'd be absolutely no hope and that's happened throughout the united states yeah i'm not making that up ohio and ohio yeah the lake and the river was just exploded yeah so my experiences in washington people generically talk about pulling back epa's authority but in communities where people live epa people want epa stronger they want the superfund cleanups to happen faster they want air pollution reduced they see the connection between a cleaner environment and great opportunity to create jobs and have economic growth i mean imagine the passaic river if we could safely canoe on it if you could eat the fish that's caught in it can't do that now absolutely not do not eat fish or crabs really really toxic and we're worried particularly we know people do eat crabs and fish from the passaic especially new immigrants to the country we've got to make sure that people know today it's not safe but i think when thinking of this multi-billion dollar superfund cleanup i like the way you've started this conversation what can the river be yeah do you really think this could be cleaned up this river not only do i think it will be i pledge to you epa will clean up the passaic river epa has experience all over the country i spent a lot of time getting the hudson river cleaned up before pcc i worked on it all electric dumped everything into the hudson river and screwed that river my whole adult life i've worked on pcb cleanup on the hudson and guess what we're about a year away from finishing that project we're going to take that experience on the hudson and make it work on the passaic what makes the passaic a more difficult task than you had in the great hudson river passaic is harder because hudson river was just pcbs and just one polluter ge here we have about 100 different contaminants 100 different contaminants 100 different polluters new jersey's equal opportunity polluters over all over the world well it is a full employment act for the lobbyists and lawyers for the companies that created this contamination and my real plea to them is for them to start cooperating and stop the foot dragon so we have a very different problem on the passaic river than we did with the hudson river well actually ge fought the cleanup of the hudson for years they spent a huge amount on advertising what was their argument their argument was the dredging was going to make the river more contaminated than if we just let it sit at much less cost to ge but now that we're almost at the end of the story we know that dredging the hudson has been a huge success environmentally and also has created 500 new jobs in upstate new york uh administrator please correct me if i'm wrong why you know we're starting the cleanup from the bay newark bay up to uh belleville newark boundary the major polluter of all the 100 over 100 polluters is uh what company well occidental actually which is now known as terrace is that what they made agent orange agent orange was made on lister avenue in newark new jersey really hot spot and epa has already gone in there but there's a lot of other companies obviously yes so we're doing that from the bay to bellevue north border and then you have from newark border north belleville border up to the dundee that'll be the next section right most of the pollutants are in those first eight miles yes over the entire river mars county correct 90 to the contamination is in the lower eight miles and that's why epa came out with a plan last april on cleaning up that part of the river tell us about the plan well it's a great plan it's one of the biggest superfund cleanups that epa will ever do it will remove 4.3 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment or mud from the bottom of the river um we want to we want to get started soon we put the plane out for public comments hundreds of people put in public comments and by the end of this year we will have a final proposal 2016. 2015. we will have a final proposal to do those first eight miles which is essentially bank to bank river dredging uh get that contaminated sediment out it's very complicated but epa has done this before we know what we're doing where did i read that dredging with phil giant stadium twice um at least at least yeah yeah what you do is you pull out the mud right and then you de-water it kind of like a french pressed coffee do that on site we do that on the banks of the river and then we clean that water discharge it back into the passaic and then the contaminated sediment or mud will be sent away to a permitted commercial disposal facility because it's really toxic in the somewhere in the united states somewhere in the united states and it's up to the the polluters those are highly regulated oh yeah by epa so it's up to the polluters to decide where they want to send it but it has to go to a permitted licensed facility when will we actually see with this plan that the epa has is developing will continue to develop uh an improvement in this river when you know what's your best judgment you're not you're not a fortune teller and i'm not either yeah it'll it'll take decades quite honestly um we it's not going to be overnight remember it took you know 150 years to create this contamination it's built up in the food chain so you know what epa tries to do is get to the source of the pollution address it and give the ecosystem some time to recover what are we doing to stop any further polluting of the passaic river well we know how bad it is right how do we stop further pollution what do we have in place now that we did not have in place before we have really important federal environmental laws that congress passed in epa enforces so we have the clean water act we have the resource conservation and recovery act so the discharge that happened for so many years the dumping that is not happening today and that's why you need a strong epa to make sure that we're not creating a new generation of toxic problems i've been in the congress since uh 19 january 97. i know who the shakers are i know who the fakers are i know what which administration has attempted to do something about these contaminants and contaminated places whether they be on land or in the water all over the country i do know in the previous administration we almost had an eight year hiatus of doing anything substantial am i using hyperbole or is this basically a fact well every administration has different priorities and i really just want to speak to the obama administration because that's who i work for and we have president put you there yes and um we have made cleaning up the passaic a real priority along with other water bodies there's also sort of been a maturation of the superfund program we've typically dealt with land properties you've been involved in countless super fun cleanups yeah you should but now epa is cleaning up the gowanus canal in brooklyn newtown creek in new york city i mentioned the hudson river that's where people live millions oh shouldn't that be a priority though why would it not be a priority to make things healthier and and to give life to what is part of water and land i think it should be a priority for every administration and in fact some of the real advances in terms of improving air pollution came when president george herbert walker bush signed amendments to the clinton air act 1990 we've cut air pollution by about 60 to 70 percent in this country because of the clean air act i i just gave a talk in upstate new york at my alma mater the college of st rose last week on on climate change and i showed a picture of manhattan before the clean air act and after the clean air act and it's stunning tangible evidence yeah and so for people who think and it came out of the the first bush's administration the amendments came out in the first minute less interested maybe that's why i lost the re-election but you know i think he did try to try to do a pretty good job in responding to what the nation's needs were yeah yeah and guess who created the epa get what guess what president established the epa right out of the gate richard nixon yeah so what we do a lot of things yeah on poverty too richard nixon we need a bipartisan commitment to protecting the environment because all we really want for our kids and our grandchildren yeah and we need people like you fighting in congress which i really appreciate because it's falling down priorities yeah and epa um has really fallen down the list of priorities and so if you don't fully fund super fund for instance you don't get to clean up the passaic river well i've one of my major responsibilities when i raised my hand back in january of 97 was to clean up the land and to clean up the waters we worked hard at that you know stopping development on some of these rivers which have led to you know much of the contamination you know there's no the water's got to go someplace and i said maybe that's another subject flooding but the fact of the matter is there needs to be some regulation in here we don't want too much regulation we don't want to uh dampen the possibilities of economic growth but we want to take care of folks that's what we're doing yeah and we want to take care of people who for instance fish in the passaic because that's their only source of affordable protein we've got to think about people who are economically struggling who want to take their kids to a park on a hot summer day why can't they jump into the river and swim they can't today but a few decades down the road once we get this cleanup done we want to live up to the goals of the clean water act which is fishable swimmable waters we can have that in new jersey administrator i'm so proud to work with you on many of these uh areas uh it's not easy no one said it was going to be easy but it's worth it i mean i talked to people for instance in wayne new jersey where we did cleanups up there it was a terrible situation um oak ridge road and now we're going to have a park there we have a dog run we have a lot of things we can do this right and if we do it smartly we can do it efficiently as well right and i just want to take a moment to thank you for your leadership in the congress you really uh know the details you know what's going on in your district and your voice has been really really appreciated on on a number of things the pacific river and others thank you uh i want to thank you for being here today sure we could talk another two hours on this which we've had we have talked we want to invite you back again and when we get this plan at the end of the year when it's completed count on my support thank you thank you administrator judith inc and thank you for being here today we really appreciate it and all that you do for your country thank you congratulations thank you in new jersey thank you and we'll be back in a moment or so uh with our good colonel uh from the army corps of engineers so stay tuned about the passaic river it's our river and we're back joining me now to continue our conversation on the passaic river is colonel paul owen with the army corps of engineers colonel paul owen assumed command of the new york district of the u.s army corps of engineers in september of 2012. colonel owen oversees the core water resource development navigation and regulatory activities in northeastern new jersey as well as parts of new york and vermont massachusetts and connecticut colonel owen also holds the title of supervisor of the new york harbor i like that i like that a west point graduate with advanced degrees from missouri university of science and technology in the massachusetts institute of technology technology colonel owen has led commands throughout the united states germany iraq and afghanistan we'll shift gears a bit discuss the corps efforts to address flooding along the passaic and thank you for being here colonel we're so proud of you and i want to thank you for all your service to your country well thank you very much you've done it uh and now you're in a very responsible position heavily responsible to have to deal with congressmen like myself and trying to get things done on subjects and problems that go back many many years correct that's correct and passaic river has been a problem that's been around for a long time as you well know and it's a difficult problem combined with a lot of factors you know your previous guests and we have to talked about the toxic problems and the pollution that we have to deal with as part of the flood control project too right and the in the toxins that are in that river and the dioxins and the pcbs etc and mercury make it even more imperative that we do something about the flooding of course that all goes on to the land that's correct and and right now there's so many uh factories and homes that are built on our rivers that there's a lot of damage done at great great great cost so how are we going to solve this problem well that's a tough problem and and you know just to go back to that too i mean we see as in the harbor we see the pollution that comes from the pacific river and uh the sediment that builds up in the harbor it's it's much more expensive to get rid of polluted sediment in the harbor so usually it's about you know ten dollars a cubic yard for material that's not polluted it's about a hundred dollars a cubic yard for material that is polluted so ten times more expensive to get rid of material that kind of sifts down through the passaic river into the new york harbor and we have to keep that at a certain depth to allow for the ships to uh to come in and unload their goods so extremely important to the economy and the quick we find a solution to help with the um with the the sediment and the contamination we'll see some economic balance this is a two-prong attack we developed a two-prong attack here one on getting the contaminants out of the river so that it can return to the glory days of recreational you know fishing the whole the whole gambit here on the other hand we're trying to stop the flooding which is eternal it looks like right gone forever making it worse of course in development along the rivers where the water's got to go someplace it's got to go someplace so the core developed five or six plans uh and you looked into and investigated what you thought the best plan was going to be right am i right so far yes that's true with all with those of us on your back all the time as well as the previous our previous guest administrator inc uh from the epa to try to get things done and not just talk about them you know people are tired of hearing these things they're tired of hearing about here's the solution to flooding because a hundred years later we have no solution right so i'm are you optimistic about this i'm we definitely optimistic i mean there's some great engineering solutions that are out there that we think will work they're expensive and everybody is not everybody's going to be happy with every decision so you know whatever we end up doing somebody will probably have some concerns about whether you have a flood wall in your backyard or a tunnel going underneath your house we've discussed those things and whether it's going to provide the level of risk reduction that people are looking for so but it's expensive and you know this as i've been across the country this area is clearly unique in the most densely populated area of the country and about 2.5 million people here and that's a mess river yeah and that's 20 000 structures i think it is uh that are in the flood plain that we need to deal with and uh you know represented by over a billion dollars worth of damages in the last uh storm and hurricane irene so irene was very damaging to this area i think that's the message that i really try to talk to people from outside this region that they don't fully understand is the really dense population and the nature of uh of the northern new jersey in general and the and the risks there are to peoples and homes and structure that are tough to educate people from montana right who think everybody you know that montana's new jersey right well it's not and uh we don't have the open space this year right we could put the water someplace if we did right uh and find some better means yeah i grew up in st louis and you know the mississippi river is a little bit different animal and you have places to build big levees and you know to spread out and you know you just don't have that here uh in new jersey and i was discussing this with the administrator we're talking about the pollution side of it uh this is a very unique river every river is unique you don't address each river the same it's talking about the hudson river which is being cleaned up too which should be done very shortly uh and one had to be done there but that was only one or two contaminants right sick river we have a potpourri of contaminants all over the place and it winds through all these towns i mean the hudson river is very broad very big it's kind of in a you know a steep um gap where the river flows through so pacific is certainly very unique yeah what do you think are some of our more reliable solutions to this problem the pacific again one of the unique parts of the pacific is it has two different types of storms that impact the area you have the coastal storm like hurricane sandy which floods the tidal area in areas like kearney and down where we saw the impacts in the pacific wastewater treatment plants and um those areas so we're actually able to address that a little quicker so we've broken that out from the pacific main stem study yeah and we're going to do a project that is a series of about 10 miles worth of flood walls and levees in that area uh from new york bay up to dundee dam which will protect against the right from which will protect against the search waters that tend to come from the ocean or from the bay side right now the other part is the pacific main stem which is floods more from rain type events like hurricane irene so you get the best of both worlds you get hurricane events from hurricane irene that floods the river from rainwater and then you get coastal storm events like hurricane sandy that floods uh because of uh storm surge well in the sandy two towns in my district monarchy and little ferry were literally wiped out because of the surge of the hackers act the burns right or destroyed et cetera et cetera i mean those people many some of them are still not back in their homes i mean it's pretty devastating so that's one kind of flooding and then of course we didn't have a lot of rain during sandy right thank god i mean erupts forsake would have been in the same position folks who live along the passaic as the people who live along the atlantic ocean yeah we weren't quite sure what where sandy was gonna hit and i remember the day before the storm i was um at the the pompton lakes dam thinking this was gonna be we're gonna get four or five inches of rain and we were gonna have a big river flooding event and it didn't quite turn out that way the surge ended up being the dominant feature of that storm and flooding is so peculiar though i remember being up at the dam uh with the governor a couple years ago well you know i'm not an engineer i don't pretend to be one but i do know if you stop water one place it's got to go another place so where's the water going to go well it's not going to go in my backyard right so that was interesting i remember that that day i think i remember meeting you that was right after i took command and i was learning uh all about the pacific river and uh so what are the options here okay tunnel so which one we talked about in the 80s right which was not acceptable primarily because of course then where was going to go that tunnel right what other options so the tunnel it was um originally authorized underneath the water resource development act of 1990 and then later uh the mid-90s i think we learned that there was some opposition to right the tunnel so it was basically uh we weren't permitted to further study the tunnel through uh so we had started looking at other alternatives which included the the um levees and floodwall options you think that's the direction we're gonna we're gonna be moving we're working with the state right now the third option is on this is a non-structural plan which is a little less uh ambitious and people that are in the 10-year flood plain would get uh have their homes elevated that's only ten years it would provide about 100 year level of risk reduction but it's only for people that are in 10 years so with each option you have different people that are going to be impacted or benefit from there's a fourth option what's that we've lost too much property yeah we've lost pers you know personnel this is too dangerous for us to just let it by grace of god go away yeah flooding is not going to go away i am proud that you're trying to address it colonel i have total confidence we work together on on some things and i have total confidence i tell my audience to have confidence you know when i say that i mean it i'm not just blowing smoke here the the question is getting all the levels to work together right and i want to be in assistance to you in that regard to get folks to work together that's not going to be easy but you took the job yeah well i did too yeah we're using our time and and money right now to refine the levy and flood wall plan we have a lot of good data on the tunnel so we kind of know that when we need to develop the data on the levees and flood walls to come up with an analysis that helps the state of new jersey make a final determination on on we're gonna have to educate the public what that means too right because the levies are gonna be higher in some areas and lower right how come it's higher up there and lowered down here and and how we're going to ever see the river right so colonel thank you so much for your time and again thank you for your service to your country we're very proud of you can i can i add one more thing congressman i just for you mentioned little ferry and monarchy as places that we didn't really have we didn't have any core authorizations or projects there but we recently completed the north atlantic coast comprehensive study and it identifies nine focus areas for further investigation and one of them is going to be called new york and new jersey harbor and tributaries right so there is a potential that well we will underneath that study look at areas like monarchy and little ferry that we're doing folks you're gonna have to happen happy to hear that a few years away that's not going to happen tomorrow i know but uh we did get money in the president's fy16 budget to study this and we look forward to coming up with a solution for thank you for relating that to us i want to thank you for watching this edition to the point you've heard our thoughts now i would like to hear what you think about today's show if you have any comments concerns or questions stay tuned our address phone number and website address will appear in a moment thanks again for tuning in see you next time on to the point you

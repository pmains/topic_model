MR. CORNYN: MR. PRESIDENT, TODAY THE FAMILY OF TYRE NICHOLS WILL CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF A 29-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO WAS BRUTALLY KILLED BY POLICE EARLIER THIS MONTH. IN THE WAKE OF THIS TRAGEDY, WE'VE HEARD THE PREDICTABLE RENEWED CALLS FOR POLICE REFORM LEGISLATION HEAR IN CONGRESS, SOMETHING THAT WE ATTEMPTED NOT TO LONG AGO. IN THE SUMMER OF 2020, SENATORS FROM BOTH PARTIES INTRODUCED POLICE REFORM BILLS TO OTHER HIGH-PROFILE TRAGEDIES, LIKE THE GEORGE FLOYD MURDER. SENATOR TIM SCOTT ON OUR SIDE, THE SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, LED THOSE EFFORTS, AND I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH HIM IN CRAFTING SOMETHING CALLED THE JUSTICE ACT, THAT WOULD REFORM, RETRAIN, AND RESTORE TRUST IN AMERICA'S POLICE OFFICERS, SOMETHING I BELIEVE IS VERY IMPORTANT. THIS PACKAGE OF BILLS INCLUDED A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES TO INCLUDE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND DELIVER REAL CHANGE TO OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I REMEMBER AFTER THE GEORGE FLOYD MURDER I ASKED MY FRIENDS, THE MAYOR OF HOUSTON AND THE MAYOR OF DALLAS, IF THEY WOULD ASSEMBLE A GROUP OF COMMUNITY LEADERS SO I COULD BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THE POLICE IN THOSE CITIES. IT WAS PRETTY EYE-OPENING. WHILE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND AM NOT-SO-YOUNG PEOPLE ARE RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT THE POLICE ARE THEIR FRIEND, AND SOMEBODY YOU CAN DEPEND ON AND CALL IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, IN SOME COMMUNITIES THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE BECAUSE OF A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'VE HAD IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. I BELIEVE THERE STILL IS A BROAD BIPARTISAN APPETITE FOR THESE TYPES OF REFORMS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE JUSTICE ACT, AND I WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT WE COULD AT THE TIME PASS A POLICE REFORM BILL THAT WAS DESPERATELY NEEDED. BUT WHEN LEADER McCONNELL TRIED TO BRING THAT BILL TO THE FLOOR, OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES BLOCKED IT. THAT'S RIGHT, THEY BLOCKED IT. THEY REFUSED TO ALLOW THE SENATE TO EVEN DEBATE OR CONSIDER THIS LEGISLATION. STRANGELY ENOUGH, THIS PACKAGE INCLUDED A BILL, INCLUDED BY SENATOR BOOKER, AND THEN SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, TO MAKE LYNCHING A FEDERAL CRIME, BUT THEY VOTED TO BLOCK CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL THAT INCLUDED THEIR BILL TO MAKE LYNCHING A FEDERAL CRIME. IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME THEN, AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME NOW. THIS WOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED THE USE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BODY CAMERAS, AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BIGGER BILL NOW, OF COURSE, IMPROVE ACCESS TO DE-ESCALATION TRAINING, AND DUTY TO INTERVENE TRAINING, AND ESTABLISH TWO COMMISSIONS TO GIVE US BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE LONG RUN. BUT AS I SAID, OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE BLOCKED IT. THIS IMPORTANT POINT IS WORTH REMEMBERING NOW AS OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES RENEW THEIR CALL FOR POLICE REFORM. NOW, IN LIGHT OF THE FILIBUSTER OF THE JUSTICE ACT, I INTRODUCED A STANDALONE BILL THAT INCLUDED DE-ESCALATION PROVISIONS FROM SENATOR SCOTT'S LEGISLATION, AND I WORKED WITH MY COLLEAGUE, SENATOR WHITEHOUSE, IN A BIPARTISAN BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW LAST DECEMBER. SO AT LEAST THAT PIECE OF THE JUSTICE ACT DID BECOME LAW, SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT BIDEN. DE-ESCALATION TRAINING IS VERY IMPORTANT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ROGUE POLICE OFFICERS WILL ALWAYS FOLLOW THEIR TRAINING. INDEED, THESE OFFICERS, IF THEY WERE TRAINED TO DE-ESCALATE THESE CONFLICTS, CERTAINLY DID NOT FOLLOW THEIR TRAINING, AND THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, AS THEY SHOULD BE, BY THE PROSECUTORS WHO WILL BRING CHARGES AGAINST THEM. BUT IT BEARS REPEATING THAT REPUBLICANS TRIED TO BRING A POLICE REFORM BILL TO THE FLOOR 2 1/2 YEARS AGO, AND OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES STOOD IN THE WAY. MR. PRESIDENT, ON ANOTHER MATTER, TODAY PRESIDENT BIDEN AND SPEAKER McCARTHY WILL SIT DOWN TO DISCUSS OPTIONS TO AVOID A DEBT CRISIS AND REIN IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING. NOW, THE ONE THING THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN AND SPEAKER McCARTHY AGREE ON IS THAT WE CANNOT BREAK, WE CANNOT BREACH THE DEBT CEILING. I GUESS THAT'S AT LEAST A START. FROM THERE, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LOT OF COMMON GROUND. NOT YET, ANYWAY. WITH THE POTENTIAL DEFAULT ON THE HORIZON, THIS TOPIC HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION, BUT AS WE ALL KNOW AMERICA'S DEBT CRISIS DIDN'T APPEAR OVERNIGHT. IT'S BEEN BUILDING FOR DECADES, AND AS I'VE SAID BEFORE, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT EXACTLY COVERED THEMSELVES WITH GLORY WHEN IT COMES TO DEFICIT SPENDING AND INCREASING THE DEBT. WASHINGTON HAS SPENT AND SPENT WITH NO MEANINGFUL STEPS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. WE ARE WRITING CHECKS, SPENDING MONEY THAT WE KNOW PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION WILL NEVER HAVE TO PAY BACK, BUT YOUNGER GENERATIONS CERTAINLY WILL. THAT STRIKES ME AS PROFOUNDLY IMMORAL. THE NATIONAL DEBT HAS SKYROCKETED FROM $3.2 TRILLION IN 1980, $3.2 TRILLION IN 1980, TO $9.7 TRILLION IN 2000, AND $31.5 TRILLION TODAY. I THINK IT WAS EVERETT DIRKSEN WHO SAID YEARS AGO, HE SAID, A BILLION HERE, A BILLION THERE, PRETTY SOON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL MONEY. NOBODY EVER THOUGHT TO USE THE T-WORD, UNTIL RECENTLY. AND DURING COVID-19 WE WORKED TOGETHER TO AVERT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND AN ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE DURING THE PANDEMIC, AND WE DID THAT ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. BUT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES HAVE SPENT ANOTHER $2.5 TRILLION-PLUS IN PURELY PARTISAN SPENDING BILLS -- THE SO-CALLED AMERICA RECOVERY ACT, AND THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. MORE THAN $2.5 TRILLION IN PARTISAN SPENDING. AND THE PRESIDENT TAKES THE POSITION THAT HE WON'T EVEN NEGOTIATE ON THE DEBT CEILING? WHEN HE'S THE ONE PERSON WHOSE SIGNATURE IS REQUIRED TO SIGN SOMETHING INTO LAW, AND BY HIS SIGNATURE HE RAISED THE DEBT MORE THAN $2.5 TRILLION IN PARTISAN SPENDING IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, AROUND HE WON'T EVEN NEGOTIATE? IT STRIKES ME AS UNSUSTAINABLE AND CERTAINLY IRRESPONSIBLE. THE PRESIDENT WAS HAPPY TO TAKE A TOUR CROSS AMERICA TO BRAG ABOUT THESE COSTLY BILLS, BUT WHEN WE HIT THE DEBT LIMIT, HE'S NOWHERE TO BE SEEN, AND HE'S POINTING THE FINGER OF BLAME AT THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND AT THE SPEAKER AND SUGGESTING THAT, WELL, IF YOU WANT TO CUT SPENDING, TELL US WHERE YOU WOULD CUT. LET'S LOOK AT SPENDING THAT THE PRESIDENT AND DEMOCRATS WERE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR. IF WE COULD CUT BACK $2.5 TRILLION IN SPENDING, THAT WOULD DO A LOT TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT LEVEL OF DEBT. BUT THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION IS IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY. I DON'T REALLY CARE. EXCEPTS TO TRY TO LAY -- AND HE WANTS TO TRY TO LAY ALL OF THIS AT THE FEET OF SPEAKER McCARTHY. IT'S WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE AND IRRESPONSIBLE. IN SHORT, PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS MADE CLEAR THAT HE EXPECTS CONGRESS TO RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT WITH NO CONDITIONS ATTACHED. BUT THAT ALSO MEANS TO LET THIS RUN AWAY SPENDING AND ACCUMULATING DEBT TO CONTINUE. THAT'S THE PART HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IS IMPLICIT IN HIS POSITION. REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT HIS POSITION IS UNTENABLE. FOR ONE, IT'S A MATTER OF FINANCIAL PRUDENCE. CONGRESS CAN'T RAISE THE DEBT CEILING JUST TO KEEP SPENDING LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. WE NEED TO GET GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN CHECK, AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. BUT THERE'S ALSO A MATTER OF PRACTICALITY. REPUBLICANS NOW CONTROL THE HOUSE, MEANING THAT THE ONLY VIABLE PATH TO SUCCESS MEANS COMPROMISE. WE HAVE A DIVIDED GOVERNMENT. THAT'S WHAT THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS GAVE US. SOME OF MY CLOATIONS LIKE TO SAY THAT -- SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES LIKE TO SAY THAT DIVIDED GOVERNMENT IS THE BEST TIME TO DO HARD THINGS. I THINK THAT'S TRUE, BUT IF IT DOESN'T CHANGE BEHAVIOR, THOSE HARD THINGS NEVER GET ADDRESSED. SO PRESIDENT BIDEN CAN ROLL OUT AS MANY ULTIMATUMS AS HE WANTS, BUT THE REALITY IS HIS PARTY NO LONGER CONTROLS ALL THE LEVERS OF GOVERNMENT LIKE IT HAS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND IN ORDER TO AVOID A DEBT CRISIS, WHICH HE SAID IS NONNEGOTIABLE, HE'S GOING TO TO HAVE TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS. SO TODAY'S MEETING WITH SPEAKER McCARTHY IS A START, BUT AT MINIMUM I HOPE THE PRESIDENT WILL WALK BACK HIS STATEMENT ABOUT NOT NEGOTIATING AND UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS, JUST LIKE SPEAKER McCARTHY HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. THAT'S THE NATURE OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT THAT THE VOTERS GAVE US WITH THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, AND WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT WORKABLE SOLUTIONS. SECRETARY YELLEN HAS SAID SHE THINKS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT DEFAULT BEFORE JUNE, WHICH MEANS WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR MONTHS TO WORK THIS OUT. I HOPE TODAY'S MEETING TWOAN THE PRESIDENT AND THE -- BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER MARK THE BEGINNING OF BIPARTISAN NEGOTIATIONS, AND I'M EAGER TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR DISCUSSION. MR. PRESIDENT, ON A FINAL MATTER, TODAY MARKS A SOLEMN ANNIVERSARY FOR OUR COUNTRY. 20 YEARS AGO TODAY SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA WAS MAKING ITS RETURN TO EARTH ON THE HEELS OF A MISSION DUBBED STS-107. AFTER 16 DAYS IN ORBIT, THE SHUTTLE WAS BOUND FOR KENNEDY SPACE CENTER IN FLORIDA WHERE MEMBERS OF THE ASTRONAUTS' FAMILIES AND COUNTLESS SPECTATORS GATHERED TO WATCH ITS LANDING, WHICH IS ALWAYS AN EXCITING AND INSPIRING SIGHT. THE SHUTTLE WAS TRAVELING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES, AND AS IT CROSSED TEXAS ON A BEAUTIFUL SATURDAY MORNING, SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED. FOLKS ALONG THE FLIGHT PATH STOOD IN THEIR YARDS, EXCITED TO WATCH A GLIMPSE OF COLUMBIA RETURNING FROM ITS 28th MISSION. THEY WATCHED THE ORBITER STREAK CROSS THE SKY AT SOME 12,000 MILES AN HOUR WHEN SUDDENLY THEY HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND SAW THE SHUTTLE BEGIN TO COME APART. WE SOON REALIZED THAT THE WORST HAD HAPPENED, THE SHUTTLE BROKE IN SEVERAL PIECES AS IT REENTERED EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE, AND ALL SEVEN ASTRONAUTS ABORED LOST THEIR LIFE. THE CREW OF COLUMBIA INCLUDED TWO TEXANS, RICK HUSBAND AND WILLIE McCOOL ALONG WITH MICHAEL ANDERSON, CALPANO CHOWLER, DAVID CLARKE AND EAN RAMON. THEY WERE SCHEDULED TO LAND 16 MINUTES AFTER PASSING OVER TEXAS. THE DISASTER LEFT A FIELD OF WRECKAGE THAT STRETCHED FROM FORT WORTH, ACROSS EAST TEXAS AND INTO LOUISIANA. TEXAS IS A BIG PLACE, BUT THAT MEANS VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE BREGD -- BREADTH OF OUR STATE WAS COVERED WITH WRECKAGE. THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED A MASSIVE SEARCH TO RECOVER PIECES OF THE SHUTTLE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT WENT WRONG. NASA OFFICIALS, NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AT ALL LEVELS BEGAN SCOURING THE LANDSCAPE TO RECOVER PIECES OF THE SHUTTLE. DIVERS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY LED EFFORTS TO RECOVER PIECES THAT FELL INTO THE TOLEDO CREEK, TOLEDO BIN RESERVOIR NEAR HEMPHILL. SOME 25,000 VOLUNTEERS FROM TEXAS AND LOUISIANA SEARCHED AN AREA THAT COVERED 2.3 MILLION MILES. THEY RANGED FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS AT NEARBY STEVEN F. AUSTIN TO TEAMS OF HAM RADIO OPERATORS WHO HELPED LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH COMMUNICATIONS. AS TEXANS AND AMERICANS DO, PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE CAME TOGETHER AT A TIME OF TRAGEDY AND RALLIED BEHIND A UNIFIED EFFORT TO HELP BRING ANSWERS TO A NATION IN MOURNING. THIS TRAGEDY HAPPENED JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS INTO MY FIRST SENATE TERM, AND I WITNESSED THIS MASSIVE RESPONSE EFFORT IN ACTION. IN THE AFTERMATH, I VISITED AN AREA NACOGDOCHES IN EAST TEXAS WHERE TENTS WERE SET UP BY SEARCH TEAMS. IT WAS REMARKABLE TO SEE THE DEDICATION OF MEN AND WOMEN FIRSTHAND ENGAGED IN THIS EFFORT. SEARCH CREWS BATTLED RAIN AND COLD TEMPERATURES AS THEY COMBED THROUGH PINE FORESTS AND UNDERBRUSH SEARCHING FOR WRECKAGE. RECOVERY TEAMS AND VOLUNTEERS FOUND EVERYTHING FROM A 600-POUND PIECE OF A MAIN ENGINE, A 600-POUND PIECE OF A MAIN ENGINE TO THE SOLE OF A SPACESUIT BOOT. THESE DISCOVERIES OF COURSE WERE CRUCIAL TO THE INVESTIGATION WHICH HELPED NASA UNDERSTAND WHAT WENT WRONG AND HOW WOAKD --  WE COULD PREVENT SIMILAR ACCIDENTS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE. IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS SINCE, THE AGENCY UNDERWENT AN EXTENSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF ITS CULTURE AND OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF FUTURE MISSIONS. JOHN CLARK, A FORMER NASA FLIGHT SURGEON WHOSE WIFE LAUREL WAS KILLED ON COLUMBIA, SAID THEIR SACRIFICE HAS EVOLVED INTO A SAFER SPACE PROGRAM. THOSE CHANGES ARE NO CONSOLATION FOR THE FAMILIES THAT LOST LOVED ONES 20 YEARS AGO TODAY, BUT I HOPE THEY CAN FIND SOME COMFORT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE AMERICAN HEROES MADE A LASTING IMPACT ON AMERICA'S SPACE PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE THE TEXANS WHO CAME TOGETHER IN THE WAKE OF THIS TRAGEDY TO PRESERVE PIECES OF COLUMBIA AND PROVIDE NASA AND THESE FAMILIES WITH ANSWERS THAT THEY SO EARNESTLY SOUGHT. THEIR EFFORTS HAVE HELPED MAKE THE NATION'S SPACE PROGRAM SAFER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL. SO AS WE MARK THE 20th ANNIVERSARY OF THE LOSS OF COLUMBIA, I'M PROUD TO COSPONSOR A SENATE RESOLUTION TO COMMEMORATE THE LOSS OF COLUMBIA AND HONOR ITS CREW. I APPRECIATE THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO HAVE JOINED IN THIS EFFORT, AND I HOPE THE RESOLUTION WILL PASS UNANIMOUSLY TODAY. TODAY WE PAY TRIBUTE TO SEVEN COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUALS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES ABOARD THE SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA. WE REMEMBER AND WE HONOR AND WE CELEBRATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH, EXPLORATION, AND THE PURSUIT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY. AND WE HONOR THEIR LEGACY BY CONTINUING TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY AFFORD HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT -- AND HUMAN

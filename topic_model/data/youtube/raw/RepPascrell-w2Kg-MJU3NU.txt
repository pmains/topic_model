well thank you for yielding congresswoman more there are major ideological constraints in this budget after all despite the fact that is going to hurt our still recovering economy the chairman has adopted the goal of balancing the budget in 10 years with drastic reductions they're necessary in order to meet that arbitrary goal so where are these reductions going to come from well there won't be any cuts in our defense budget the highest in the world that spending is actually going to increase so we're not going to be asking millionaires and bit about any of the tax breaks they've inserted into the tax code over the past 30 years well Jim to give them more that makes sense we aren't going to be getting any meaningful savings out of Social Security Medicare the next ten years although the budget does take the radical step of authorizing the program and ending the Medicare guarantee for retirees so by process of elimination where the savings got to come from the only slices of the pie left are the social insurance programs that helped the poor in the middle class of this country and that's my barometer for looking at any budget whether it comes from the president whether it comes from you whether it becomes some Uncle Harry it doesn't matter that's the bottom line there 125 billion he cuts the SNAP program that provides food to the poorest Americans and their children and prevented four point four point nine million Americans for falling into poverty into in 2012 there's 732 million dollars in cuts billion in cuts of Medicaid programs by converting them to a block grant in the total of 1.5 trillion dollars and Medicaid got stand back I said trillion dollars when you throw in a repealing the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and according to the Kaiser Family Foundation block granting Medicaid in repealing the ACS expansion of the program will result in between 30 and 40 million Americans losing coverage thank you so much mr.

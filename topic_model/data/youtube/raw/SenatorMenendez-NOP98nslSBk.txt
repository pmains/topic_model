thank you for that generous introduction i was thrilled to accept ziggy's invitation to speak with you all today he is an energetic passionate stalwart and yes persistent fighter for freedom in the baltics and around the world i admire his tenacity and we are indebted to him for bringing us all together at this crucial time of course i wish i could be there with you in vilnius in constitution hall but circumstances beyond my control prevented me from joining you today constitution hall is a place that symbolizes lithuania's fight for freedom and its commitment to democracy a place that stands as a reminder for all freedom fighters around the world a reminder of victories one and autocrats vanquished a reminder of lithuania's proud and long history as a free people but also as a reminder that freedom is not set in stone and democracy is not a finished product it is something that we need to continuously fight for and defend this is a critical moment in history for lithuania and the world in the last month the head of the russian security council threatened lithuania on a visit to kaliningrad russian cyber attacks have hit lithuanian targets and the russian duma has questioned lithuania's very independence so many of you were there in 1991 when soviet tanks crushed innocent lithuanians you saw russian soldiers walking the streets of vilnius your buildings have withstand damage from russian bullets we all know what is at stake in this fight as vanguards of the democratic order we have a responsibility an obligation to step into the breach to defend the principles that free people cherish and millions more yearned for around the world today from kiev to havana from taiwan to minsk freedom is under threat it is incumbent upon us to take up that mantle and do our turn as stewards of a cherished legacy started by the likes of aristotle and correas in greece by thomas jefferson and martin luther king in america by jonas zemantis who led freedom fighters against the brutal soviet occupation this legacy lives on today with names like navalny otero and yes zelinski as defenders of freedom and democracy we must take up that mantle it is our turn in the arena our turn to stand in the shadow of these giants and defend the principles that they dedicated their lives to as chairman of the united states senate foreign relations committee i am fortunate to come into daily contact with some of these brave voices for freedom nowhere is the struggle for liberty more evident than ukraine and while the news in donbas and southern ukraine is hard to hear sundays one simple fact remains ukraine is winning and it will emerge from this terrible conflict victorious and do you know why i believe this it is because none of the arms that we have sent them no is it because of the diplomatic support we have provided them no is it our humanitarian assistance no my friends the simple reason why ukraine has momentum the reason why these freedom fighters will emerge victorious is deeply rooted in the bones of the ukrainian people rooted in their thirst for freedom rooted in a desire for a future for their children not dictated by moscow rooted in a simple creed the people of ukraine are the only ones fit to determine their country's future president zielinski and the brave souls fighting off russian attacks are on the front lines in the fight for democracy and this fire will propel them to victory now many commentators like to say that around the globe democracy is backsliding that autocrats have the upper hand and the good guys are on their back foot but i tell you they are wrong inspired by the courage of our ukrainian brothers and sisters i believe we are in the midst of a global democratic renewal one where democrats and freedom fighters are seizing the initiative and standing up for their rights the pessimists are wrong because you gathered here together today are prepared to defend these universal values that burn in the hearts of all of our citizens now i am not naive about the world we live in yes the challenges from russia and china are formidable they possess dangerous resources and are relentless in their drive for power but international solidarity with meetings like this show that we who support democracy are here and we aren't going anywhere it has been over 80 years since the american state department condemned the occupation of the baltic states in what would go on to become known as the wells declaration it stated that quote the people of the united states are opposed to predatory activities no matter whether they are carried on by the use of force or by the threat of force that is as true today as it was eight decades ago we who support democracy are focused and committed to building a free world principles matter values matter and we aren't going to back down we aren't going to cower we aren't going to sit by silently because to do so would be the most terrible sin of omission put another way to ignore war crimes to ignore atrocities to ignore tyranny is complicity plain and simple now some of you know my story and you know how important this fight is to me personally my parents came to the united states as refugees from cuba escaping a dictatorship that lives to this day my family had to struggle to give us a shot in life but as hard as that struggle was we knew we had a chance because we were free free to pursue our goals free to work where we pleased free to speak out for what we believed in but you can't do that today in cuba that's why last july the cuban people took to the streets in unprecedented nationwide protests in response the dias canal regime arrested hundreds of peaceful protesters including the renowned activist luis manuel pero he is a leading figure in cuba's protest movement and for the last year he has been held in a maximum security prison just two weeks ago the regime sentenced him to five years in prison for contempt public disorder and defamation but in the face of repression luis manuel has been unwavering in his commitment to democracy human rights and the end of cuba's dictatorships principles that lithuania has backed with unwavering support lithuania the only european country to refuse to cooperate with the repressive cuban regime and it's not just cuba despite the threat posed by china lithuania welcomed a taiwanese representative office in vilnius a display of bravery and commitment to democratic values that other nations should emulate because we all have a responsibility to stand together in this fight against totalitarian states taiwan is only 180 miles off the coast of china a thriving nation that lives in beijing's chatham taiwan's flourishing democracy of today provides a case study in the promise of democratic consolidation taiwan's democratic reformers were crushed in the 1950s and for decades taiwan was effectively a one-party state by the early 1980s democratic momentum was inevitable putting taiwan at the forefront of the third wave of democratization and today there can be no question that for taiwan democracy is the only game in town so when a country like china tries to bully a nation like lithuania for recognizing taiwan like-minded democracies have to stand up of course lithuania faces dictatorships much closer to home just over the border in belarus the lukashenko regime has been brutal in its repression of freedom and democracy it is a regime that has responded to peaceful protests with beatings and deaths that has ordered police to arrest people for putting opposition flags in their windows that has forced an aircraft to the ground and abducted a journalist headed to lithuania and yet in the face of these acts brave opposition leaders have continued to speak out they have shown the belarusian people and the world that there is a real true alternative to the violent lukashenko regime and indeed it's an honor to see that svetlana tinoshkaya is with you today she's testified before my committee in the senate and we have met several times in washington her courage and that of her supporters is an inspiration to all of us thank you sir shifting to russia over this long rule potent has tightened control of russia by shattering independent media arresting activists and poisoning or killing anyone that gets in his way when he invaded ukraine many russians were horrified they quit their jobs they packed their bags overnight they left their homes and fled russia and many in the opposition came to vilnius so even though putin's thugs have transferred alexander navalny to a high security prison his opposition movement has thrived in vilnius they continue to engage with those back in russia trying to break through putin's lies they continue to fight for a russia where voices are not silenced where people can choose their leaders freely without fear or retaliation and they do all of that from lithuania as the great poet marianis wrote of lithuania you are beautiful dear homeland a country where engraved heroes are sleeping not in vain our ancestors defended you not in vain our poets praise you yes i too believe lithuania deserves the highest of praise and this my friends is why i wanted to speak with you why i needed to speak with you to simply say two words thank you thank you to the people of lithuania for standing up for the cuban people when the rest of the european union turns a blind eye to their struggle thank you for hosting the belarussian opposition who fight every day against a terrible regime thank you for hosting the russian opposition who violently marshall on to the darkest of days and thank you for supporting our friends in taiwan despite crushing pressure from beijing not to do so the fortitude of the lithuanian people and your leaders set a proud example for the rest of the world your geography and population may be small but your impact is mighty pound for pound or kilo for kilo you are punching far above your weight every day in the international arena i am proud to call lithuania a friend and stalwart ally as we stand shoulder to shoulder in the fight for freedom my friends democracy is poised for a comeback and so to those of you listening today who champion the values of democracy and self-determination do not give up to those who have been forced to flee their homeland do not lose hope to those who are living in the shadow of a brutal dictatorship do not despair if we dedicate ourselves to the cause of freedom around the world democracy will flourish light will win over darkness and we will triumph over tyranny thank you and god bless

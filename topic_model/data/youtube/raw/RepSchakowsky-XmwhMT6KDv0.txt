hi it's congresswoman jan chiakowski and i'm back with my plans and plans well this week families all across this country have been trying to process the idea that 19 children and two teachers were slaughtered were murdered in uvalde texas you know this doesn't happen in other countries around the around the world the united states is really unique and what makes us unique is access to guns i had calls in my office and i actually spoke with uh with one of my uh one of my constituents who was absolutely distraught she has a seven-year-old son her name is anna cade and she wants us to do something wants us to do something real to address gun violence so um in our conversation which i actually talked about on the floor of the house of representatives one of the things she said is that the one thing that i can't say to my seven-year-old son is that you will be safe in school and i looked around the hall to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and i said isn't that what we all want to be able to say to our children but none of us really can we were in a debate on the protect our kids act a package of seven pieces of legislation that the house of representatives led by the democrats we only at the end had five republicans to join us to have common sense laws that would protect our children protect our families stop these mass shootings stop the violence stop the access to these deadly weapons so let me just give you a quick rundown of the the bills that that that we passed um we're raising the age from um from 18 to 21 to buy an assault weapon now believe it or not there really is data that says that that will reduce the number because often it is young people under than under 21 who do these things but i also want you to know that um coming up in the house of representatives we're going to be considering a ban on assault weapons like we had under the clinton administration and to no one's surprise the number of these kinds of mass shootings decreased getting these military-style weapons out of the hands of anybody who wants them and goes out on a rampage it works so um that's one bill the the other is that we really want to do a crackdown on gun trafficking and straw purchases this is really important in illinois because the majority of murders by gun happen from it's because the guns come from states outside of illinois we have wonderful very strong gun laws in the city of chicago and throughout the state of illinois so we have to crack down on these guns that shouldn't be coming across the border and coming and being trafficked in in illinois so that is very very important to us we have a a number of other bills including the safe gun storage act requiring that the guns that are in households are responsibly kept away from children and others and locked up we also passed we outlining out lawing high capacity magazines that are designed designed for no other purpose than for being able to shoot many people all at once background checks for anyone who would purchase a ghost gun what's a ghost gun it means it doesn't have any id identification any stamp on it so if you want to purchase that kind of a kit then you would have to have a background background check and you should know that the house of representatives has already passed over a year ago a comprehensive universal background check requirement so far the senate has not acted on on that so we had we we passed this package of legislation we are going to continue to push and push to get all hopefully of them passed but one other bill that we also did as a separate vote is called the extr extreme risk protection order act what this does is would allow family members to be able to report to the police authorities that someone in a house in that household or someone close to them um will do either harm to himself or others is likely to do that so the police have to make a determination on uh whether or not to send that to a federal district court so it's not just willy-nilly you know i think someone's really dangerous take their guns away or you know don't let them buy a gun it has to be adjudicated to say that yes we're going to not allow a dangerous person either because he's going to commit suicide or because he or she is uh you know gonna he's gonna go on a rampage um so that um some people call it the red flag law to red flag someone who is a potential danger so that bill passed as as well and now we're going to you know proceed ahead but you know the gun violence is now in the united states of america the number one killer of children more than car accidents and more than cancer any disease it's time for us to get a handle on this problem and we are determined to do just that in addition an important piece of of uh legislation that i have worked on for now a couple of years is coming to a hearing called the american data privacy and protection act you know i know many people feel very frustrated on the internet feel that they can't control their personal information um that they are uh you know being abused by the platforms uh and that they don't have any control and so we have now a bipartisan piece of legislation that we're going to be having a a hearing on and we are happy that we've been able to work for example on my consumer protection subcommittee my republican ranking member gus bilarakis from florida we are working on this bill together and the the bill would say things like companies cannot collect any more data than they absolutely need for that particular transaction you know sometimes you think you know why would they want my cell phone or why do they need my date of birth or whatever no only the uh information that is relevant to that service or transaction can be uh can be collected it would ban the take it or leave it kind of terms like well yes but if you want to proceed forward to get what you want mailed to you then you have to say you agree to all the cookies and all the things you know that you have to approve um and so no there's no take it or or leave it consumers will have the right to access to delete and to move their data i'm talking about portability so if you want to leave that particular platform or company you will have the right and the ability to to do that and if you want to delete everything you will have they'll be required to give you that opportunity to to to do that we protect children on the internet in this legislation i know that many parents worry about that and we're going to have additional protections we require that all the companies that the the platforms abide by the community standards that they announce you know companies like facebook will say oh this is you know what we what we do to protect consumers if they say that and they have to list things that they will do then they have to live by that or they will face accountability liability i'm really looking forward to finally completing our multi-year uh effort to get a privacy bill for americans to be able to join the european union and some states that have been doing it around the country and say that consumers will find that their privacy is protected online and now let me turn to the january 6th committee hearings about 20 million people watched that that hearing i was riveted myself on thursday evening i thought that it was very powerful and very disturbing at the same time we we saw how the capital police how so many people and how the capital of the united states was under attack the young woman who was the um from the capitol police said it was like a war zone she was never trained for that kind of activity as a police officer she was pretty severely injured during that and her testimony was very very powerful i think it's very important that the american people see the details of exactly what happened in this attempted coup on uh of the united states of america and it will be very thorough the committee has interviewed over 1 000 different individuals and a lot of new information that we haven't heard before i think we will we will see i also met this week with a with about 30 people from the assyrian community within the ninth congressional district you know we are one of the most diverse districts in the whole country and we have a growing population of assyrians many of whom come from iraq in fact during one of the boats that took place in iraq there was actually a polling station in um in the district where people who are from originally from iraq could go and uh and vote there so i met with about 30 people led by this amazing young woman at a tour sargon who is the first assyrian woman to ever be elected to anything in illinois and she now serves as a trustee in the village of lincolnwood and also mary o'shanna who's a skokie park district commissioner who's also a syrian were among the leaders there and they asked me if i would join join the newly founded assyrian caucus in the house of representatives and i was happy happy to do just that well it is prime month happy pride month but you know it is 53 years since the what they call the stonewall riots when police raided a gay bar and and beat and harassed um and and just went after violently against the um gay community that was uh at the bar but this time 53 years ago they fought back and it really triggered the whole fight for equality in our country for the lgbtq community and uh and i am so proud that i uh and grateful really grateful to these people who set the pace way back then and am proud that in night in 2015 because of my activism as well um was able to be inaugurated in the chicago lgbt hall of fame proud of that and the pride parade is coming up on june 26th this year and i'll be in it as usual and it is i think just one of the most colorful and fun parades that we have in chicago so you know it's a really good time for everyone for the family to come out and enjoy the uh the pride parade and stand up for equality for for everyone and finally as usual i'll just end with a little bit of a covid uh update um we know that in the state of illinois there were 4 294 new cases and 10 more deaths so we're not totally done with it yet continue to be careful some states are still seeing an increase in the in the number of cases and the biden administration um announced that it will is gearing up to roll out vaccines for children five and under and the first vaccines could start as early as the week of june 20th and then the program being ramped up to make sure that there's sufficient vaccine for all the children that you want to have vaccinated that are younger than that so have a uh have a a wonderful weekend and i will talk to you next week thank you for watching my

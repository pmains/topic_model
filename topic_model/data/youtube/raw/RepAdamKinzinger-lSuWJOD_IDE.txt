now as one of the Republican members on the January 6 committee congressman Adam kinzinger of Illinois Congressman thanks so much for for being here tell us why you think that's significant uh that that video of Pelosi and Schumer and others trying to get the capital some protection if you're a conspiracy theorist they've been believing that this was all set up now I'm sure they're going to say that this is a fake video or something now but what that shows is in the midst of that chaos the focus was on how do we defend the capital yes how do we get back to work this is a constitutional imperative that we certify this election how do we bring enough people in to take control of the capital again and do that the conspiracy theorists have said again we basically invited them in we wanted this to happen somehow it doesn't make sense this video showed today how intense really that battle was from a congressional leadership perspective not sitting there waiting for events to happen but proactively trying to get this job done so I don't know where McCarthy and scalise and stefanik you're the the three house Republican leaders were during that period I imagine they were somewhere safe as well but they've all been pushing the idea that Pelosi is somehow to blame for what happened that she didn't do enough that day of course that's just a way for them to deflect yes from talking about Trump but the UC Pelosi right there well that's things Kevin McCarthy the biggest disappointment of a congressman that I know not because of what he said or done it's because he knows better he said it like a week after January 6. he said the truth and then that like power that star is in your eyes comes and he has to become a speaker when I see him talking about that or I see any Republicans saying the problem is the capital wasn't secured enough and that's something we're looking at that but that's like blaming somebody who who had a home invasion because they didn't like the front door yeah um it's insane and it's a deflection and the only people that don't see right through that are those that choose not to see right through that because they don't want to look at January 6 and see the truth so the big action today by the committee was Voting unanimously to subpoena Donald Trump for testimony and and Records do you think that he's actually going to testify we'll have to see I know he should the requirement now is for him as a former president he has the same rules as any American as you or I if you're subpoenaed by Congress you come in and testify um you know but I think it's important for us as we've taken this investigation we've got as many of the pieces as we can together we're very clear there are people that won't come in and talk to us you know we haven't at the end of this Congress this committee ends we've been this is Donald Trump's doing and when this even started I mean I I even was you know did he not know what was happening did people around him do this it is very clear that he knew what he was doing he wanted to stay in power and now we want to hear from him there was uh some suggestions today at the hearing that some individuals at the Secret Service in the U.S Secret Service haven't told your committee the truth about whether or not there were any threats ahead of the Insurrection you showed uh evidence that there were some passed on by the FBI and others and also other misrepresentations tell us tell me more about that look I don't know what's going on in the Secret Service there's whether it's cultural issues whether it's this desire to maintain secrecy we know about the text messages that disappeared despite the preservation requests um remember after Cassidy Hutchison testified what she had heard you know she wasn't in there but what she heard about happened in the limo and you had these Anonymous sources come out and say that is being disputed in the in the Secret Service Tony ornado and everybody will testify we said great come in never win it never came in they never had they didn't come in to talk to us there are a lot of inconsistencies that we're going to continue to investigate from things people have said to evidence that we have gotten that will be either explored in the future or definitely in the report a friend of mine Steve says that we the committee and also the news media we're describing this wrong we shouldn't be calling the attack on Democracy we should be calling it an attack on the United States because I guess his argument is truly you attack the capital you you attacked the Democratic process you are attacking the United States and if it was anyone else other than Trump supporters maybe we would be calling it that I think you're right I mean imagine if this was Isis even without you know if they did the exact same thing it would be an attack on the United States whether they're citizens or not I I can see it as both ways because democracy is important to defend right now sure one of the things I believe is democracies and the United States in particular we're not we're not defined by our bad days we're going to have bad days we're defined by how we come back from those bad days that's what we're doing on the committee right now we have to take a full accountability for what happened so that my kid your kids can come up in a country that can take accountability for its wrongs and that can actually give people hope opportunity and prosperity speaking of your kid I have no doubt that your kids someday will be reading in the history books about what you did uh and you know the kids of the Republicans who know better who are going along with the LIE will will read it too it must be kind of lonely uh where you are right now especially seeing people fellow veterans in Congress fellow Republicans fellow conservatives I don't know I mean are you still friends with them I I mean we get along still friends with some you know you have to try to put that aside but I look if somebody truly believes all the January 6 conspiracies I begrudge them less than my colleagues who know the truth and have a position of leadership one in 700 000 people serve in the job I serve in like your chances of ever being born in another life and doing that again are zero you have a you have a responsibility to the Constitution not to what your District wants you to say in a time like this your District may want you to do one other you sworn oath to the Constitution of the United States and 99 of my Republican colleagues are failing every day I would I for them I'm sure they're afraid of what their kids are going to read in the history books I'm proud of what my kids are going to read in the history books and I guarantee every one of my colleagues kids they're going to believe what we put out there because it's going to be the truth okay the truth congressman Adam Kensington Republican of Illinois thanks so much for being here really appreciate it

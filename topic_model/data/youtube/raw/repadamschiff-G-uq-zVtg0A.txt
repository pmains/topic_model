hearing one of the members we saw doing that joins us now congressman adam schiff is a member of the january 6 investigation he of course is also chair of the house intelligence committee and he's standing by to talk with us now from the capitol uh mr chairman congressman schiff thank you so much for being here tonight i know this is a busy and a big night well it's good to be with you and i thought it was a very powerful night uh i think the chairman laid out the historical nature of what we went through that day the unprecedented attempt to interfere with the transfer of power and then i think the vice chair importantly wove together the narrative about these multifaceted efforts to overturn the election the pressure on state legislatures and legislators the pressure on the vice president the the continued pushing of these false claims of fraud even when the president's own attorney general said they were bs uh and how it led to that day and then to hear officer edward's testimony i can't imagine a more powerful refutation of the lie that this was a normal tourist day that this was legitimate political discourse and so i we did i hope show the country just a bit of the amount of evidence that we have and uh and gave the country a sense of what lies ahead in our future hearings congressman schiff there's um there's a there's a there's a historical importance to this which defies both politics and party affiliation this is also happening in a partisan and political environment we after all are holding these hearings as part of a congressional investigation that said there was a provocative piece of evidence described tonight by liz cheney about unnamed republican members of congress she said during her opening statement republican congressman scott perry was involved in trying to get jeffrey clark appointed as attorney general which was described as an effort to try to get the justice department to use lies to put the weight of the department behind the effort to steal the election result for for for president trump she said representative perry has refused to testify here as you will see he contacted the white house in the weeks after january 6 to seek a presidential pardon multiple other republican congressmen also sought presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election we have seen some things pointing at this in the past i've never seen it put that bluntly before is the implication of this evidence that the committee has collected that members of congress republican members of congress committed what they believe to be crimes in this plot and thereby therefore sought pardons from the president before he left office well look i i think the fact that members of congress were interested in trying to get a preemptive pardon for their role in the effort to overturn the election tells you a lot about their consciousness of guilt uh if they thought that what they were doing was above board then of course there would be no need for a pardon and you know this is part of the reason we wanted these members to testify it's probably part of the reason why they refuse to testify but nonetheless uh it gives the the public a sense of just that the depth of information we've been able to accumulate the scores of witnesses you saw some of that deposition testimony tonight uh the real challenge for our committee you know frankly is um how do we choose what is most important to share with the public and uh and i think that uh what we will try to do is make available in these hearings as much as we can and then provide in online resources for others a wealth of other material for you and other members of the press and public to scrutinize congressman is it clear to you and other members of the committee what the exact witness lineup will be for the seven hearings that have been described we heard uh vice chair liz cheney today describe the rough topics and rough areas of evidence that will be covered in each of the next six hearings that will happen during the month of june is it clear to you now is it actually a settled matter who the live witnesses will be or some of that still in under negotiation you know i think many of the witnesses if not most of the witnesses are already settled upon arrived at uh but you know there may be changes among the witnesses new witnesses or others that are replaced so i don't know that it's going to be static we're continuing to learn new information continuing to talk to new witnesses and going back to some of the witnesses we've interviewed now that we have more information so i don't want to say that that it's fixed in place uh but we certainly i think have lined up most of the witnesses uh in this set of hearings now this may not be the last uh of the hearings as well um congressman chip it's troy reid um you know the footage that we saw as incredibly disturbing as it was sort of begs the question um of how coordinated this effort was on the inside of the capitol we saw people roaming throughout the capital and and chanting speaker pelosi's name and and seeming to hunt individual uh and individual members in leadership in that way there's been implication in the past from some members that fellow members of congress assisted in some way in planning or providing logistics um perhaps even directions as in terms of where to go inside the capitol by doing tours will we get that kind of information and evidence through these hearings uh you know i i can't go into too many specifics you know we have investigated uh what role any member or members of congress may have played in the run-up to that day or on that day we've investigated the issue of tours potentially tours or a tour involving a member or members i'm not at this point authorized to go into that evidence but it is part of the body of work that we've been able to uncover and we'll be sharing i don't want to overstate or understate it but this is just a part of what we'll be presenting to the public and what would be the potential implication if members if a member or members did participate in providing logistical information we know this is not a trial this is not a criminal proceeding it's informational it's for us to know the history of what happened but could a member like that can you imagine a member who was exposed theoretically in these hearings continuing to serve in congress unimpeded well look it's inexplicable to me how members of congress seeing what took place on january 6 and we were of course there and those police officers saved our lives it's inexplicable to me that so many of my republican colleagues could go right back onto that house floor um knowing uh how many capital police officers had been beaten and injured and pick up where they left off uh trying to overturn the election so there's a lot that frankly i can't understand our job will be to uh expose all of the the conduct of that day and what led to it in terms of remedies that the justice department may have that is ultimately a decision for the attorney general but our role is really one of protecting the public of looking at what took place who was involved holding those accountable by exposing their misconduct and then proposing reforms to protect us going forward coursemanship it's lawrence o'donnell i i'm going to assume that most people who work at the justice department watched this hearing tonight even those working in civil divisions and environmental areas that have nothing to do with the work you're doing but there would be people watching it who do have overlaps with the work you're doing do you believe that those people working at the justice department tonight learned things in your hearing that they did not know uh i'm certain that they learned things that they didn't know because uh you know some of the material that we presented and much of the material that we've accumulated is part of our investigation it's not part of the justice department's investigation uh and i'm sure they are watching it carefully and they should watch it carefully um i would hope that they're doing their own investigation and they're being as aggressive and diligent about it as we are um ultimately we have very limited uh authority in terms of what the justice department does we have the most authority lawrence as you know when someone is in contempt of congress and we've made four referrals and the department has only been willing to go forward with two of them i hope that with respect to the events that we're going to be sharing information with the public about over the next few weeks that the justice department if they haven't uncovered this evidence themselves is paying very close attention and that they will follow the evidence wherever it leads as the attorney has general has said that he will after all you know federal judge as we again quoted this evening in california has already found on the basis of the limited evidence that he has seen that the former president and others around him likely violated multiple federal laws carson it's nicole wallace one of the first things that congresswoman liz cheney said in her opening remarks was this as you will see in the hearings to come president trump believed his supporters at the capitol and i quote were doing what they should be doing this is what he told his staff as they pleaded with him to call off the mob to instruct his supporters to leave are you prepared now to to share which witness said that and will that witness testify either on video or live in these hearings you know i'm not prepared to uh make that kind of a disclosure i i certainly would expect that we'll be presenting uh you know uh the sources of different information uh so that the public can understand how we know what we know i think that's an important part of telling the story but at this point i can't speak for the chair and vice chair in terms of particular witnesses or disclose the sources of some of our information congressman adam schiff chairman of the house intelligence committee member of the january 6 investigation sir thank you uh for your time tonight this was quite an undertaking for you and all the members of the committee i know you're back at it uh with that morning hearing on monday we will hopefully speak to you then sir thank you thank you

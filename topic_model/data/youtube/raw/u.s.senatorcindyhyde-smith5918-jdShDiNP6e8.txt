thanksgiving is a time to surround ourselves with family and friends to thank god for his bountiful blessings it is a time to reflect on all that we have to be grateful for i hope this thanksgiving looks different for you than last year's holiday with more loved ones around the table and fewer people on zoom or face time our recovery from the pandemic has taught us not to take for granted our ability to freely gather with those most important to us as we come together this year we must take time to thank the brave men and women of our military first responders and all of those who are dedicated to protecting us i pray for peace and safety for them and their families on this holiday i also pray for our fellow countrymen suffering in these hard economic times those in need of food shelter or helping hand we must recommit ourselves to be there and to share our bounty with our neighbors in their time of need and know that they will be there for us in our time of need finally i believe better days are ahead for our blessed nation and give thanks for a deep faith that god will direct us the right path to all mississippians i hope you have a warm safe and happy thanksgiving god bless you

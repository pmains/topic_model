well good morning good morning we are starting off with some good news this morning I'm Jenna Ellison you're listening to Jenna Ellis in the morning my good friend and probably my favorite person in Congress representative Mike Johnson and the house Republican con conference have introduced a resolution condemning intimidation tactics of pro-abortion activists this comes as the Republican majority is finally doing some good things so I have Congressman Johnson with me today on the phone Congressman thank you so much for joining me this morning and this resolution I think is really important and you're planning to introduce it today so what is this all about hey Jenna great to hear your voice my friend you're doing a great job and uh thanks for highlighting this um it is good news you know there is a republican majority in the house again and we are turning things around and we're beginning with uh really some big statements about our top priorities our first day of Congress this week we repealed the 87 000 IRS agents that the fine Administration tried to hoist upon Working Families and small businesses um last night we reassed or we established two uh new select committees one on the weaponization of the federal government which is going to be a must-see TV I promise you and then a a select committee on the threats from the Chinese Communist party today uh house concurrent resolution number three is one that I authored and it's a bill now I think we have over 130 Republican co-sponsors on it there'll be more uh as we go to the floor but this is a very simple very important piece of legislation because what we're doing today is condemning the attacks that have been committed against pro-life facilities and groups and churches in the wakes of the in the wake of the Dobbs opinion and and also we're calling upon the vine Administration to take action to bring the perpetrators to Justice we can't stand for violence and vandalism and intimidation and threats against people who are trying to help women uh when they have uh troubled pregnancies and and that's exactly what's happened the federal government has done nothing about it and it's time that we take a stand this is a really great move and I applaud you and commend you for this and I hope that this will pass with a full Republican support do you expect any Democrats to go along with this and actually condemn violence in this context you know it's a great question Jen I certainly hope so I mean we got I don't know the total number but I think we had a 150 or so Democrats join us on the resolution last night uh to create the new select committee uh about the Chinese threat the threat from the Chinese Communist party so there are some reasonable people in the room and hopefully they will join us on this one because listen regardless of where you are on the issue of legalized abortion you ought to at least come along with us and condemn uh the you know property destruction and and death threats and all of that it's been made against uh pro-life persons look we live in America and as you and I have discussed many times before you know part of being in this country is respecting and living by the principles of free speech and that the three exercises of religion and all of our fundamental rights but but because we have free speech here um we have the ability and and we have the responsibility to to be to listen to voices that we don't uh always agree with right I mean that's part of the price of free speech is that sometimes you're going to hear uh positions and advocacy that you don't agree with but it doesn't mean you could go tear their property down or or threaten to kill them and you know when when the Supreme Court opinion in Dobbs re-established the authority of individual states to prohibit the killing of unborn children it sent some in the Democrat Party over the edge I mean these radical pro-abortion activists went off the deep end beginning last summer we have over a hundred instant incidences uh where they've gone after and destroyed and vandalized churches and pro-life centers and pro-life organizations it is it is a blatant violation of federal and state law and it needs to be prosecuted uh vigorously so that we send a message that this is not who we are in America yeah and that makes so much sense and there was a lot of I think intentional misframing of the Dobbs decision and what that actually did uh when that came out by the mainstream media and the liberal left that had been using just as a pretext to shut down the arguments of pro-lifers well this is precedent it's super precedent it's magnificent precedent or whatever their you their words were to describe it and really all the Dobbs decision did was return the issue of abortion regulation back to the States so that the state legislatures could rightly and properly contemplate how they would deal with that issue and so as you were in Congress one of the things that you once told me that I've never forgotten is that Congress is a team sport and it is um where you have to work with your colleagues from not just within your conference but on the other side of the aisle and we're seeing so much contention and vitriol and I think mainstream media loves to amplify that because it's great TV but it actually did surprise me that there were a number of Democrats quite a few that voted for this select committee to hold China responsible in some other things so when you're talking about some reasonable people reasonable people across the aisle uh what can you expect as a leader of the Republican conference to genuinely get done in congress with this select committee with other legislation that would then have to pass through the Senate as well well we have a real challenge we have to be realistic about uh the math right because it is a team sport and it's also about simple numbers you know the vote counts and so we have a very narrow majority in the house it is a republican majority and we're going to use that we're going to use that power to turn the ship of State around and it's going to take some time because it is like the Titanic right um but with the with the three or four vote margin on any vote we don't have a lot of margin for error so we're going to have to keep that team together uh pulling together an advancing legislation that not only fulfills our commitments to America but but sends a strong message about the contrast between the two diametrically opposed Visions for this country the Republican party and today's Democratic party um and then it goes over to the Senate and you know we don't have a majority in the Senate and we certainly don't have the 60 vote uh threshold that we will need for most substantive legislation so the reality is a lot of what we pass through the house is not going to become law if the Senate did pass some of it and certainly we hope they will well and we'll work towards that every single day it's likely that President Biden is not going to sign a lot of that legislation so we have divided government we're in that era the best we can do is play vigorous defense against the president's agenda stop the madness and slide towards socialism and advance you know meaningful Common Sense legislation that shows America what we're for you know John Quincy Adams said one time the duty is ours the results are God's we're going to do our responsibility here and and do our best and then we're going to trust the rest of God I think what it leads to ultimately as you and I know is a a massive uh political contest for 2024. the White House is at issue again of course to control the Senate and are continue to control the house and so we have to show the American people between now and then what we're for where we're headed what we're going to do I think if we do that effectively we're going to have a great election cycle uh right ahead of us yeah laying the groundwork to 2024 is I I think the right approach and that sort of realistic expectation of what can be done but resolutions like this that are specifically condemning violence against abortion or rather Pro um uh you know pro-life clinics and and other things like this um are really good measures that are really forming an equilibrium I think because for so long especially over the last two years we've seen uh the violence from uh leftists that hasn't been condemned by the Democrats and uh and just seeing how all of this has worked I think a lot of conservatives have been very frustrated with the lack of accountability and in just the um the last like five minutes or so that I have with you um Congressman Mike Johnson for those who aren't as familiar with you and they should be everyone should follow Congressman Mike Johnson on social media follow all of your media comments I think it would be really encouraging for the AFR family listeners to know your world view perspective on our system of government and that you are a solid faith-based Christian as a leader of the Republican conference so even though this is a large question for the last five minutes um talk to me about your perspective of government and why we are founded as a Christian Nation thanks Jenna I do a five hour seminar on that so let me get here again highlights I mean look the best way to summarize it is what GK chesterson said one time he was the famous British Statesman and philosopher and he he said you know America is the only nation in the world that was found Upon A Creed he said the Creed is listed with almost theological Lucidity or Clarity in the Declaration of Independence you know if you look at our nation's birth certificate it says it all second paragraph famously we hold these truths to be self-evident and Jenna what is the self-evident truth it's something you cannot know why because God stamps it in your heart right we hold these trees to be self-evident that all men are created equal not born equal created equal by someone right we hold these shoes to be self-evident all men are created equal they're endowed by their creator god with certain inalienable rights the rights the lives Liberty Pursuit of Happiness among these look our rights don't come from the state they don't come from an Earthly King they come from the king of kings and that belief is what created what started sparked the American Revolution what uh what empower and enabled and encouraged us to break away from the tyranny of Great Britain and to found a nation based upon the principle that we aren't indeed one nation under God but we have to remember right now and you and I discuss this all the time we're still an experiment in self-governance right there's no guarantee how long this is going to last when the founders set it up they said you better be really careful because if you're going to have a government of by and for the people themselves you have to maintain some basic principles and Foundations one of which is the reminder that you are beneath God it is one nation under God truly and by Design that's the only way it's going to work so you have to have as Washington said in his farewell address of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political Prosperity religion and morality are the indispensable supports John Adams comes next he says look our constitution is made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other we have to remember that a vibrant expression of Faith a vibrant uh defense of moral values and virtue is not only good for individuals and families and communities in the country it is essential for our survival you cannot maintain a constitutional republic if you lose those principles and those foundations and so I'm so grateful for AFR and the American Family Association everybody involved they've been doing that for decades in the trenches when you and I were litigating cases we would often assist and help AFA and sometimes afrs and uh for legal defense and counsel and all the rest and and I pray that in the days ahead that they remain as vigorous and engaged as they always have because we're certainly certainly going to need it absolutely and thank you for that wonderful overview and for your fight uh in Congress because um I think so many people just see what's on the mainstream media and they see these uh clips of the vitriol back and forth and sometimes get discouraged that there aren't good men and women in the highest offices but to know that you are there as a solid Christian as an attorney as a husband and father and someone who is fighting for the moral premises and the foundation of being under God that our country was built upon and you're fighting in the halls of Congress every day is very encouraging and I hope that everyone listening doesn't forget that that even if you don't see these types of expressions in the media every day there are very good people and I'm so grateful to know you Congressman Mike Johnson and your fight because this does matter to the country and you are making a difference every day a and you have a podcast as well so how can people continue to listen to you yeah thanks a lot my wife Kelly and I you know Kelly we we do a weekly podcast called truth be told with Mike and Kelly Johnson it's

events political issues the big news of the day from a Biblical perspective and how are we supposed to think about that as Believers what are we supposed to do about it and we're just kind of unpacking these insights every week it's been a lot of fun it's got a huge National audience we've been really blessed and honored by that and that's wonderful and so it's Mike and kelly and it's k-e-l-l-y uh so Mike and kelly uh yeah so Mike and kelly and so listen to that podcast and I'm so grateful thank you for your friendship your mentorship of me I mean a lot of these ideas and some of

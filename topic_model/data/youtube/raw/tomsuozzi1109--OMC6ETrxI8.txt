you know the things you see on TV and read the newspaper about the dysfunction in Washington DC it's true things are not getting done too many people are fighting with each other they also focus on local issues trying to take care of the problems that people face here right here in Queens you have noise abatement with the airplanes and helicopters for helping veterans to get the benefits they need bringing money to the local Veterans Hospital so then they can fix their infrastructure and provide better services to people so there's a lot that needs to be done in Washington and Iran on getting things done so I'm getting things done locally

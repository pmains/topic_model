well I how many were here last month ago or so when we have when we did in town homie nephew yeah okay a little little smaller crowd and at that one we had really tried to want to get some your questions addressed right off from the very beginning we're finding us we're doing town hall meetings a lot of those questions are continuing to be familiar gas prices obviously one of those as you know actually every single i did that means seven or nine town hall meetings that we can a three day period and every single time gas prices were were usually about the tenth thing that came off with surprising a little bit especially for us the gallon but you talked about that talked about budgets will talk about what's happening I just got an update Eric Cantor about some of the some discussion the binding roof every person that email to you as well and go through so what is that month is anybody have a burning issue or question if they want to get out of the way right away yes sir you have to remind me of your name if you know my phone is shooting at microphone nothing that's right i remember you and I had interacted when I back when I worked for heating so both parties are reading your own Lord Shiva spending I don't want to know both parties stand Republican Stan one knows I want to know for you how are you saying I know you got social security if you want to say that we're how how about the Medicare we're out and maybe three other areas I want you to tell us this afternoon what you are going to propose a reduce spending okay all right we'll tackle that anybody else have a issue a way up I was looking at that was attention we're not but my actual bus yeah but that one run because i said this amazing one this is this is a chart that will see up here to see them to that it because it's kind of solid bringing wine right what that is is if you look at as projected of what is happening and what it does is it takes the historical average so that's that us 18.2 percent so that is it what I'm saying is what if you projected and what they are right now no this has kind of work up there and then the bush access happened it goes down and it hasn't actually come back up yet but in the future you have the chart going that up and it see ya in a foreseeable future to what the more stable future is this was and this was on the office management budget and CBO professional budget office numbers as what they are projecting and hits I apologize takes like 20 17 or so whatever they are projecting from there they're not projecting they're just using the 18.2 percent the historical average normally serviceberry after your policy left an accident explainer no okay you're um it seems like we're talking about long-term long-term problems Social Security is at least 25 rupees there's a little closer but still we talk about long-term problems we're also talking about time standing drastically and with the state happen safety cut up and percent which is largely if you look at the job stuff the bio sector jobs are up most of the movies on your jump rope is not as high as it should be is because they've been offset by john paulson sakes teachers are those are actual companies with their governments during a recession and a really fragile recover that's also showing signs not continued it I don't understand the economic theory that says cutting cutting cutting now in the middle of the economy is really good fragile I fail to see I fail to see any of us who is where austerity fighting is going to do anything but dampened economy slowed down it's already pretty slow and i'm not sure if you adhere to the notion that if we hadn't done something it would have been our worst thirty percent wasagamack without the only loss of signal question but nobody under par here moving on that but there there there are other artists if there is we do by the way Nomar knows we are you said I look at this advantage land or unemployed yeah yeah curious we are good yes Rebecca well I want to have I would I have something that the question was where the safe unless we're here to listen not just the date no I have no problem we are not going to agree on everything or not let's just when i'll just get that away on the data here in the second row on a dad and I don't agree on everything yeah the that's not that's not going to be unusual so we didn't know season one hands going up and I think maybe we just didn't see a few things out there I've got a little series of slides that will happen to get through ram and get through mall but let's let's do this I think this is how people will just start get a few of those things and become pretend I'm sorry you kind of already follow up

I would say there are some events on the test
that you just don't do on a regular basis. They might have gotten rid
of a couple of them. So for me, one of the events
was a kneeling basketball throw. So basically you would kneel on the ground
or you'd have to launch a basketball as far as possible. I was pretty wild, I think, in terms of things
that people might struggle with. Pull-ups is definitely one of them. I know in a public school we typically don't do a lot of pull ups
and other calisthenics like that in your physical education
classes. So that's definitely a good one. And then depending on the academy
that you're applying to, like there's just going to be different things
you want to focus on. The big three for anybody is always going to be pushups,
sit ups and then focusing on your cardio. So your capacity to run anywhere
between one mile, to about 1.5 miles
doing short sprints, stuff like that.

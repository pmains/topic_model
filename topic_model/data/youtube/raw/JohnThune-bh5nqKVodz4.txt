thank you Mr chair I know this ground is being covered a little bit already with with Senator Grassley but I am very interested in the irs's plan annual plan on how they're going to deploy the 80 billion in mandatory funding that you all received um he and I have a bill we've introduced the IRS funding accountability act among other things it would require the IRS to submit to Congress a detailed spending plan annually and I it seems to me at least keeping Congress informed of IRS progress any changes in that plan make sense regardless of the status of our bill I know you've been asked this but I would like to just press on it a little bit if I might and that is if confirmed will you direct the IRS to updated spending plan annually for Congress to review 80 billion dollars a six times your annual budget we're talking about 87 000 new employees and I so would you commit to uh uh you know will you direct the IRS to updated spending plan annually um I I would say it's so important that the plan we have is transparent is updated is clear to you and the American people just sitting here I think an annual update is reasonable I do want to talk with the uh with the IRS employees and the treasury Department once I become a federal employee if I'm fortunate enough to be confirmed to confirm my understanding but the general principle of updated plans annually resonates with me so um thank you and I hope that you will be able to make a more definitive commitment after consultation so um in this new funding 46 billion of it goes toward enforcement and only four percent toward helping with the uh filing claims of ordinary tax filers and um to me it seems like the the record at least the current record recent record the IRS which includes 10 million unprocessed tax returns and a 13 phone call pickup rate in 2022 that improving taxpayer Services ought to be the number one priority now obviously the allocation of funding doesn't suggest that when you've only gotten when you have 46 percent allocated to enforcement and Audits and going after people only four percent or 3.2 billion for uh taxpayer service so again in terms of priorities is you look at this issue what will be the higher priority for you when it comes to administering the IRS funding allocation better customer service to taxpayers or increasing the number of audits on Americans it'll be a dual priority Senator uh equally focused on improving taxpayer service in particular for Working Families and small businesses and side by side with that will be a commitment to improve the irs's capacity to unpack complex returns which is something I understand today they lack that capacity well I I hope that you will um that the agency will double down when it comes to just dealing with um prioritizing taxpayer Services I mean those that that data those numbers are just non-defensible inexcusable and and needs to be fixed let me just ask and maybe it's been asked already as well but um the data breach going back to 2021 the propublica data breach uh there still hasn't been any you know accountability on the leak or the breach of private taxpayer information and I know you're going to punt that to the justice department but I I just do you think it's acceptable that here we are two years later and there still is any information about what happened there who the who the leaker was and I'm just if confirmed would you take steps to ensure that that kind of confidential taxpayer information the one that the the the breaches there's accountability there and two that it doesn't happen again as soon as I think about the nuts and bolts of Tax Administration data security is a top priority I I don't know how to build trust with the public when there's a sense that there's a there's there's risk mature risk of unauthorized disclosures what I what I what gives me some degree of comfort you mentioned the justice department but what gives me some degree of comfort is the taxpayer Inspector General um is extraordinarily important role whenever there's a potential breach to understand the root cause so one of the things that I will absolutely do is work with the Inspector General to understand what do they see as the risks and any specific action or activity that's taken place have they investigated what are the root causes are there corrective actions because if there are we will make them okay and I just again would reiterate that it would help enormously if there would be accountability for those that have already happened we don't have that yet for the one that happened in 2021

E HAVE EVER SEEN. LEADING OFF OUR DISCUSSION TONIGHT IS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA, HE IS THE OUTGOING CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH SELECT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT, CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HERE WAS HOW YOU GOT NOT JUST TO AN ADJOURNMENT AT THE END OF THAT THIRD VOTE. BUT IT WAS A UNANIMOUS VOICE VOTE FOR AN ENJOYMENT AND YOUR ADJOURNMENT -- THERE WAS ONE NO VOTE FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM. -- THE TIME IT TOOK TO COUNT UP THAT VOTE TALLY THAT WAS THEN ANNOUNCED BY THE CLERK? BECAUSE IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHE ANNOUNCED THAT VOTE TALLY, REPUBLICAN TOM COAL MOVED FOR ADJOURNMENT. AND IT WAS UNANIMOUS. HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT? >> LAWRENCE, I THINK, AS YOU WERE SAYING, IN THE ABSENCE OF A SPEAKER, HAS A LOT OF AUTHORITY. AND THE CLERK VERY QUICKLY MOVED THAT MOTION TO ADJOURN. AND THERE IS NO OPPOSITION. AND SO WE ADJOURNED. AND -- HAS BEEN CITING PRECEDENT THAT OFTEN GOES BACK DECADES OR MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN 100 YEARS IN THE CONDUCT OF HER OFFICE. I AM SURE HE SHE HAS THE PARLIAMENTARIAN ASSISTING HER. BUT WE ARE IN KIND OF UNCHARTED TERRITORY ON THE FLOOR -- FOR EXAMPLE, MEMBERS TAKING -- AND VIDEOS, AND WHY ARE WE ALLOWED TO DO THAT WHEN -- BECAUSE THERE ARE NO RULES YET. SO WE ARE IN KIND OF UNCHARTED TERRITORY. BUT WHAT WAS SO STRIKING TO ME, LAWRENCE, IS HERE YOU HAVE THE DEMOCRATS, FAR MORE DIVERSE PARTY IN EVERY RESPECT, UNITED BEHIND A SINGLE PERSON, HAKEEM JEFFRIES, UNANIMOUS. AND NOT JUST UNANIMOUS -- BUT A GREAT DEAL OF WARMTH AND RESPECT FOR HIM. AND THEN YOU JUST HAD THAT CIRCUS ACT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT MCCARTHY IS HAVING IS, BECAUSE HE DOES NOT STAND FOR ANYTHING, BECAUSE HE HAS NO CORE SET OF CONVICTIONS, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE RESPECT OF HIS MEMBERS. AND SO AS YOU SAY, HE WON'T BE MOURNED IF HE FAILS IN THIS BID, OR IF HE SUCCEEDS AND LATER FAILS, BECAUSE HE HAS NOT DEVELOPED A FOLLOWING. THE ONLY ONE WHO TRULY, I THINK, PROBABLY IDENTIFIES WITH HIM IS GEORGE SANTOS, WHO RESPECTS HIM AS A FELLOW TRAVELER WHEN IT COMES TO HIS LACK OF ADHERENCE TO THE TRUTH. LET'S >> LET ME JUST GO BACK TO THE ADJOURNMENT POINT FOR A SECOND. WE JUST HEARD THE VOICE VOTE. DID ALL THE DEMOCRATS VOTE FOR THAT ADJOURNMENT? BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON TELEVISION WHILE IN THIS LOWER PARTS OF THE DAY ABOUT THE STRATEGIES ON ADJOURNING OR NOT ADJOURNING. WHO DOES IT HELP? WILL IT HELP KEVIN MCCARTHY IF THEY ADJOURN? WILL THE DEMOCRATS VOTE FOR ADJOURNMENT IN ORDER TO HELP KEVIN MCCARTHY? SO, IS THAT A SURPRISE MOTION BY TOM COAL, WHO IS A KEVIN MCCARTHY LOYALIST, THAT THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT EVEN VOTE ON? IT WAS A VOICE VOTE JUST ENTIRELY A REPUBLICAN VOTE? >> IT WAS A SURPRISE THAT THEY MOVED TO ADJOURN. AND FRANKLY, THE CLERK GAVELED IT SO QUICKLY, I'M NOT SURE THAT IT PROMPTED ANY DEBATE. AGAIN, YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT THE CLERK HOLDS THE GAVEL TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND DOES NOT HAVE TO LEAVE IT OPEN FOR MUCH DEBATE. SO, THAT MOVE VERY QUICKLY. WHETHER IT HELPS THEM OR HURTS THEM, I DON'T KNOW. I SUPPOSE IF WE -- MORE VOLTS VOTES, AND MORE FAILURE. BUT I THINK EVENTUALLY THEY WOULD -- TO ADJOURN. I HAVE TO THINK THAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW IS ONE OF TWO THINGS. EITHER MCCARTHY WILL CUT SOME KIND OF A DEAL WITH THESE REBELLIOUS MEMBERS OF HIS CONFERENCE, OR THEY WILL HAVE SEVERAL OTHER VOTES THAT HE WILL FAIL AND THEN THEY WILL HAVE ANOTHER ADJOURNMENT, WHERE THEY WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER NOMINATING SOMEONE ELSE. >> WE DID SEE THREE VOTES IN A ROW IN WHICH HAKEEM JEFFRIES GOT THE MOST VOTES. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ELECTIONS WHERE THE PERSON WITH THE MOST VOTES DOESN'T NECESSARILY WIN. THIS ONE HAS TO BE A MAJORITY, ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF THE HOUSE. AT SOME POINT, THOSE 20 ARE EITHER GOING TO BECOME FOUR. -- THEN HE BECOMES SPEAKER. BUT IF THEY DON'T MOVE, WE CONTINUE DOING THIS. AND AS I SAID, AND AS HISTORY TELLS US, THERE IS NO DEADLINE FOR THIS. CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THAT WILL MAKE FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO HAPPEN TOMORROW? >> I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW. BUT I CAN SEE OVER TIME THE EMBARRASSMENT FACTOR, THE DISGRACE, THEIR DEGREE TO WHICH THEY ARE SHOWING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL THEY, ARE THEY CAN'T GOVERN, THAT THE COST OF THAT WILL GO UP EVERY HOUR, EVERY DAY, AND EVENTUALLY SOMEONE WILL CAPITULATE. I -- THOSE REBELLIOUS MEMBERS WILL CAPITULATE AT SOME DEAL. THEY WILL TAKE TO THE FLOOR -- AS HE DID TODAY AND SAY, -- THIS ISSUE TO THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION. WE DID WHAT WE SAID HAVE TO DO. OR THE REPUBLICANS WHO CAPITULATE AND DROP MCCARTHY. -- PUBLICAN CONFERENCE CAPITULATE. ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE. BUT I THINK EVERY DAY AND EVERY HOUR, THE COST OF DYSFUNCTION BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY SHAME THEM INTO DOING SOMETHING. THE PROBLEM WAS, HAVING THIS MUCH TROUBLE JUST PICKING A SPEAKER -- HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GOVERN AFTER? THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE EASY PART. FOR 100 YEARS, IT HAS BEEN THE EASY PART. IF THEY CAN'T EVEN DO THIS, OUR HOPE IS THERE FOR THE ABILITY TO RUN THE CHAMBER? >> IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE FOR KEVIN MCCARTHY AFTER THIS, JUST ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT HE ACTUALLY ENDS UP WITH THE VOTES FOR SPEAKER? WILL HE LOOK BACK ON THESE DAYS AS THE EASIER DAYS? >> IT IS HARD TO LOOK BACK ON THIS FAILURE TODAY, THEY SORT OF FAILURE, AS AN EASIER DAY. BY THE IF HE HAS CAPITULATED ON ALLOWING ANY FIVE OF THOSE 20 PEOPLE TO CALL A VOTE AT ANY TIME TO DETHRONE HIM FROM THE SPEAKERSHIP, THEN HE IS GOING TO CONSTANTLY BE AT THEIR BACK AND CALL. IT IS -- BOEHNER OUT, IT'S WHAT DROVE RYAN OUT. -- KEVIN MCCARTHY'S LACK OF A CORE SET OF VALUES, LACK OF ADHERENCE TO TRUTH IS -- AN ACID IN THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE, GIVEN THEIR PARTY LEADER, DONALD TRUMP, HAS NO DEVOTION TO TRUTH? I DON'T KNOW. WE ARE FINDING OUT TODAY IT WAS NOT A NASA. BUT I ALSO THINK, IN THE LONG TERM, IT'S NOT AN ACID EITHER. PEOPLE DON'T RESPECT HIM BECAUSE HE DOES NOT STAND FOR ANYTHING, EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF. AND YOU DON'T LAST VERY LONG THAT WAY. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF,

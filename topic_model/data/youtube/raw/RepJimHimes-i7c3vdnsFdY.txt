people were expecting an apology from the president they will be disappointed he is defending his decision to disclose highly classified information to Russian officials he's been tweeting this morning as president I wanted to share with Russia at an openly scheduled White House meeting remember u.s. media was not allowed to it we only learned about photos from it from Russian media who were allowed at the meeting I says he had the absolute right to do what he did facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety humanitarian reasons plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against Isis and terrorism does this make it okay joining us now is Democratic congressman Jim Himes he serves on the House Intelligence eddard discretion in that regard than he so can't be illegal but do you believe that that explanation he gave is unsatisfying well not be illegal but it's completely beside the point look at the Washington Post story is to be believed what happened is that the president gave a lot more information that would typically be given it might in that you know let's just imagine because the Washington Post story said that it was location so let's just work with that let's imagine that the president is describing a building or a neighborhood these are places that have limited numbers of people right so let's just imagine it's a room that four or five people have access to now all of a sudden four or five people are turning up dead quite possibly the source for whatever this piece of intelligence was so that's the sort of close in issue much larger of course is the fact that you know we rely on cooperation and tips from intelligence services and sources all over the world and what has now happened is that all over the world whether it's in China or Hong Kong or Australia or Africa people are saying to themselves you know what I might give a tip that the next day is being discussed on CNN new day because the president talked about it with somebody who in this case Russia doesn't necessarily have an interest in keeping it secret now we have another situation as we did with the Comey firing where there was an initial story that went out and now the president in an effort to clarify seems to be something that may be closer to the truth with Comey it was the AG gave us this report so we did it and then the president came out and said I was going to do it anyway I thought to myself about this Russia Russia situation it's false I got rid of Comey last night HR McMaster came out respected general national security adviser to the President of the United States and said stories false he didn't give up any sources or methods or any which isn't the reporting and some could say he was parsing his words too carefully but the president this morning isn't saying that he's saying yeah I did it and it's okay that I did it because I want to help Russia get more involved with Isis and it was the right thing to do he's saying something different apparently it's just a suite but this is the way the president likes to communicate most often it seems like he's saying I know what did Himes I know why you're concerned about it I'm not my interest with Russia are more important than what you're talking about again there's there's there's all this haze out there HR McMaster as you point out enormous Lee respected on Capitol Hill and elsewhere he came out and he said the president didn't disclose sources and methods that may be technically accurate but again if the Post story is correct and that there were locations described you might not need to say hey Chris and Damascus gave me this information our foes can figure that out but just this discuss to something larger and much more concerning because it's the same deal as the Comey firing you know this stuff happens the president appears to just go off script to do something that can have profound implications and then the White House spends the next couple of days trying to get the story straight what that tells you is whether it's the promise tax reform plan that people at Treasury were looking at each other and saying oh my god what did the president just promise or the firing of Jim Comey for which we still have four different explanations or what happened you know the story that broke yesterday this president is sitting in the Oval Office and making snap decisions that are not based on the advice of his people that we see the White House trying to work out in the days that follow now you know that that may not be a huge problem if you've got to go through a legislative process if the president decides he wants to repeal dodd-frank say or whatever but my god the man has you know untrammeled authority with respect to national security in places like North Korea Iran you know this is not the way you want to run national security policy so we know the president watches a lot of television pays a lot of tension in the media we know he watches the show often if he's watching in this morning you know what he's not seeing Republicans telling him he did the wrong thing and saying that they're going to speak out and they're going to exercise their checks and balances on him and I'm not talking about anything exaggerated like impeachment I'm talking about just censure and you know healthy robust debate in our democracy about what to do Paul Ryan put out a statement this morning that was a a two-line state in the first line of it wasn't even accurate where he said we have no way of knowing what happened in that meeting we know from the reporting they're talking about transcripts we know from the reporting that the White House wanted to take certain information out of those reckonings of the meeting those transcripts because it's sensitive information they don't want it out there twice but that's what they're getting from the Speaker of the House the Trump is getting Trump is getting basically muted silence the GOP isn't coming forward you need to have both parties for there to be any meaningful reproach here seems like it's not going to happen yeah it's wild I mean as a Democrat I'm thinking back just over a year ago when the president President Obama is is pounding the table for trade promotion Authority for the trans-pacific partnership and the vast bulk of his own party in Congress basically told them to go pound sand you know in fact not just didn't just say no but raised all kinds of hell against the president here you have an issue which isn't so much about policy you like the trade deal this is this is this is historical right I mean my Republican friends need to think back to moments like Joseph McCarthy and who stood with them and who stood up and showed courage and said this is not us or our back to the Nixon administration when when that administration was coming apart a few Republicans who are remembered to this day for their courage and for their standing for the Republic instead of for their narrow interests are celebrated today and there's an awful lot of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who I hope this morning are asking themselves do I want to go down as the guy who just sort of went along with with you know really something ominous in American history or do I want to be known as somebody who stood up and said I'm putting my country ahead of my party once again something so unorthodox I and so self-serving where Russia involved once again casting light on the need for answers in that investigation always good to have

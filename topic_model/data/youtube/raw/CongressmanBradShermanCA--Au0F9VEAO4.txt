and today is his birthday happy birthday mr. chairman you're recognized for five minutes you don't get any more just because it's your birthday Donald Trump said crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including the drug trade I ask unanimous consent to put in the record a report by Rand talking about crypto currencies use by terrorists hopefully without objection without objection such as the order not here to be anti Facebook I was amped i cryptocurrency back when you were anti crypto currency crypto currency either doesn't work in which case investors lose a lot of money or it does achieve its objectives perhaps in displaces the US dollar as the or interferes with the US dollar being the sole reserve currency of virtually the sole reversions reserve currency in the world that role of the US dollar saves the AirVenture American family $1,000 in interest costs because money pours into the United States because of the role of dollar the Federal Reserve can turn over up to 100 billion dollars in profits to the US Treasury that we in Congress spend because of the power of the US dollar the US dollar is an excellent currency as a means of account it serves all the needs except it's really bad for tax evaders drug dealers terrorists and that unmet need can be met by a new currency if we make drug dealers just ten percent more effective how many American deaths is that over the next decade does it compare to the deaths we experienced from terrorism we'll have to see but those who are introducing cryptocurrency have got to pause and wonder what effect they'll have on the power of the United States to impose sanctions right now turkey is stopping at 20 miles into Syria not because of US troops weep we're out but because of US sanctions because of the role a u.s. dollar we stand to lose all that because cryptocurrency is the currency of the crypto patriot mr. Smith Velazquez pointed out that you wanna that you're gonna wait for regulators to sign off regulators are working with old statutes your lawyers are going to show that there's a loophole in a 1940 Investment Company Act that gets you where you want to go and the regulator's can't stop you and you're gonna call that regulatory approval as if the people in 1940 knew what you had in mind what you've made clear is that you will go forward unless donald trump appointed regulators stopped you and in you will go forward if you can just find loopholes in statutes but you'll deploy a mountain of law a horde of lobbyists to prevent us from writing a new statute mrs. Maloney asked you a question that you forgot you still forgot to answer it but let's be clear you're gonna be making powerful burglary tools and letting your business partners commit the burglary you are going with all the power of Facebook to try to create a new currency you're gonna call it the Libra but you're the person behind it that's why it's called I call it the suck buck you are going to create it and then say oh it's our business partners your white paper says your business partners are going to use your tool to have anonymous accounts and then you have the gall to come here and say you're gonna follow all the know your customer how do you know your customer with an anonymous account then mr. Meeks calls your bluff on this idea that you can creating a payment system for the poor and unbanked the poor and unbanked need pesos they need dollars that they can buy something at a local store you've done no effort to help the unbanked anywhere else at any other time you've and you should you should create a payment system with a zero where they've got close to zero fee but the real money is in the tax evaders and to some extent the drug dealers I know you've got at least a hundred lawyers they will tell you that what you're doing is legal and that you will be safe but given the harm that this can do they could be very wrong and if this explodes the way it might especially you will not be able to hide behind the idea that you didn't create the Libre organization that it's just your business partners that have wallets designed for drug dealers and terrorists i I have a few more things to say but for the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world and say that's who you're really trying to help you're trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency drug dealers terrorists tax evaders thank you the gentleman from Missouri mr. Luetkemeyer is recognized

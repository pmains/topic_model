president senator from Connecticut thank you very much mr. president mr. president the most sacred the most important the most profound responsibility that a president in the United States has is to keep Americans safe everything else that we care about the citizens of this great nation the best nation on the planet it matters very little if our physical safety and the physical safety of our families of our loved ones aren't assured that's job number one for the President of the United States now mr. president I believe that the president has likely committed offenses that are worthy of impeachment I think it's likely that information is gonna emerge from the house's inquiry that will present Republicans with clear evidence that the president's abuse of office has been serious now obviously we need to wait for the articles of impeachment to arrive in the Senate if they do arrive before any of us decide our vote on removal but the publicly stipulated facts already surrounding the president's shadow foreign policy designed not to advance the national interests but is personal political interests they are damning now so far my Republican friends have rallied to the president's side despite public opinion moon pretty quickly against the president and in favor of an inquiry in the house and so today I want to use my time on the floor to ask just a simple question of my Republican colleagues I want to ask what the costs are to the physical safety of the nation of continuing to protect the president from the consequences of his misdeeds because as we gather here in the Senate for our fall session we are watching American national security policy go completely and fully off the rails our global reputation our credibility have been shattered to pieces and no one knows whether they can be reassembled our nation's defenses have never been weaker our enemies are gathering strength by the day fear of American power is waning our global assistance system of alliances is falling apart our friends are turning away from America because we are a demonstrably unreliable partner and those friends may never come back right now before our eyes American power is in freefall and our nation's safety is at risk American citizens are looking to this place for leadership but when they lift up the hood looking for steely eyed Patriots all they're finding is blind partisans what's the cost I asked my colleagues of letting America's slide into global irrelevance II continue how many American lives are going to be lost ultimately because we sat on the sidelines and we let American influence fade as our president becomes a toxic commodity the butt of jokes an international pariah what must it take for this body to put a side party and come together to salvage our shrinking American security mr. president I want to take a few moments a few more than I normally take when I come down to the floor to take my colleagues on a tour of the world right now just so that everybody understands how dangerous the situation has gotten to understand just how broad the scope of our foreign policy dysfunction is right now because just maybe maybe if you see the crisis all in one map all in one summary my colleagues might wake up to the magnitude of this emergency so it's hard to start anywhere but in the Ukraine the power of the American executive branch has no equal no individual in the world has more power than Donald Trump has today and that power comes with responsibility comes with guardrails the one firm promise that a president must make to those that he governs is to use the powers of the Oval Office for the national interest not for his personal or financial interest but it is now clear beyond a reasonable doubt after all this testimony much of it from Republicans before the house that President Trump has turned our support for Ukraine into a personal poker chip to be cashed in in order to get Ukraine to help him destroy his political rivals this just isn't allowed in a democracy but the damage done by Trump's corruption of the Ukraine relationship is far beyond this broken covenant with the American people he pulled essential assistance to Ukraine just when their new president needed US support the most Trump is weak in Ukraine dramatically by pulling them into this mess and Russia's the beneficiary make no mistake Putin has won for the time being and those fighting for democracy have lost for the time being sold out by their Fairweather American friends who were more interested in destroying the president's political opponents and supporting Ukraine now other nations on Russia and China's periphery wondering whether to simply acquiesce to the bullying dominance of their neighbors or put up a fight for independence they're now less likely to do the latter knowing that the United States is there only to help if their nation fulfills our president's personal requests the world's eyes this week are down here in Syria where the president has engaged in one of the worst most abominable acts of double-cross in the history of the American presidency we convinced the Kurdish military to fight Isis for us we convinced them to take down their defenses against the potential Turkish invasion because we promised to protect them and then out of nowhere a week and a half ago Trump stabbed the Kurds in the back he announced the pullback of our forces and invited by press release the Turkish army to march into Syria and destroy our ally the Kurds who today he is denigrating telling the world that they're not actually as good of fighters as everybody says they are the damage to our nation's security done by this one single act is almost too comprehensive to list in one speech Isis teammates detainees have escaped their jail cells and are now likely reconstituting and possibly readying new attacks against the United States they can plot without fear of interruption because the Kurds have ended their fight against Isis to try to survive this Turkish offense now in addition to Isis Russia the Syrian regime and the Iranians all grew stronger in Syria overnight as we stood down and they will quickly reap the benefits of trumps abandonment of the Kurds it's a nightmare in Syria today and it's going to get much worse before it gets better let's move down to China where president-for-life ji has been steadily consolidating power building a model of totalitarian control the denies basic rights to its population of 1.4 billion the United States has watched from the sidelines as China not only conducts cultural genocide against against its Muslim population in its own country but also grows its global clout and exports its model and technology of repression around the world China's military continues to gain and strength and push their unlawful territorial claims further in the western Pacific we do virtually nothing China's belt and Road initiative is forging linkages across the globe building foundation for long-term technological economic and strategic dominance the United States stands on the sidelines under the trump administration there's some total of our bilateral interactions thus far with China has been a bungle disastrous job-killing trade war it's a trade war that really only made sense in Trump's campaign speeches but never had a chance to succeed without the help of other potential partners that the president never tried to enlist every single day Trump is losing the trade war badly our trade deficit with China isn't going down it's going up the tariffs on Chinese imports could cost middle class American consumers $1,000 a year and our economy has slowed down and is on its way to potentially losing 300,000 jobs because of the trade war it's an unmitigated economic disaster for our nation and this nightmared like all the others seems to be getting worse all the while China forges ahead to corner the market on next-generation technologies like 5g drones and artificial intelligence leaving America and American companies potentially shut out of these markets no where as China's heavy-handed repression been more apparent than right here in Hong Kong and yet again we have been totally absent in Hong Kong brave pro-democracy protesters should be seen as America's best friends Chinese people who are risking everything to fight for basic freedoms in an increasingly totalitarian state there's no better way to undermine China's unfair trade model than to promote the rights of its consumers and its citizens but Trump promised the Chinese regime that he would offer no support to the Hong Kong protesters an unconscionable promise that he's kept while trying to run circles around him on trade talks staying in Asia let's run right up the road to the most immediate and terrifying existential threat a nuclear-armed homicidal dictator with the capacity and willingness to nuke us and our allies in the region in North Korea a lot of ink has been spilled on the pomp and circumstance of Trump's summits and the ongoing love affair that he claims with Kim jong-eun but what has actually been the result of nearly three years of Trump's North Korean diplomacy besides stroking his ego the answer is nothing Kim continues to fire missiles into the Sea of Japan he continues to quietly build up his nuclear stockpile even the freeze on nuclear and long-range missile tests is temporary and the North Koreans are warning that they might resume that at the end of the year meanwhile we abandoned the South Koreans we canceled our joint military exercises we nearly withdrew our troops entirely Kim got international recognition and essentially a free pass to keep building his arsenal and making it more deadly well we weakened all of our regional alliances America and the world are dramatically less safe right now all over the world in fact dictators and would-be dictators are racking up stunning records of human rights abuses right now because they know that under President Trump America will really raise no issue no protests so go down here to the Philippines for instance where there have been 20,000 people who have been vanished in the extrajudicial massacres by President Duterte no protests from the United States as 20,000 have vanished thousands of political dissidents are being locked up in places like Turkey and Egypt and Saudi Arabia these are supposed US allies and have no one to speak for them because America now doesn't do anything about civil rights are human rights we've vanished from the human rights playing fields in Saudi Arabia in fact their leadership felt so emboldened by Trump's embrace of brutal strongmen that they'd kidnapped an American resident who is critical of the Saudi regime they chopped him to pieces and then they got rid of the body parts the dots are piling up in the Middle East the response from the United States to Jamal Koosh oh geez murder was a visit to Riyadh by the American Secretary of State for a smiling photo-op to make sure that every foreign leader in every corner of the world recognized that human rights abuses would be forgiven pretty immediately by this new American regime elsewhere in the Middle East I don't know that I can just keep on piling up more and more dots but elsewhere in the Middle East things are falling apart fast due mostly to the Trump administration's incompetence it started with this nonsensical fracture of relations between Saudi Arabia and another key US Gulf ally Qatar it was the kind of disruption that frankly would normally be papered over and fixed by a competent US administration probably in days but three years later the two countries Saudi Arabia and Qatar still aren't talking largely because we did nothing to fix it making matters worse Saudi Arabia and their one remaining stable friend in the region UAE aren't getting along now either under trump the war in Yemen began to rage out of control tens of thousands of innocent Yemenis many of them little children died needlessly as Trump piled more weapons and more bombs into the war and did really nothing to try to find a peace agreement between the parties who for a year had been begging the United States to step in and play our traditional role as mediator the conflict has raged on for so long due to Trump's unwillingness to use America's diplomatic muscle that events on the ground became so chaotic that the Saudis and the Emiratis have now parted ways now with the cutter ease the Saudis and the Emiratis all on different wavelengths the potential for proxy wars between these wealthy nations could get much worse all over the Middle East now in Iran right next door the campaign of blind escalation and provocation is been disastrous every one of the president's national security advisors told him to stay into the Iran nuclear agreement it focuses energies on addressing Iran's other malevolent behavior in the region like their ballistic missile program or their support for terrorist organizations Trump ignored all his advisors like he's ignored all the rest of the council that he's received on major foreign policy matters and he canceled the agreement and implemented a series of unilateral sanctions against Iran coordinated with absolutely no one Iran feeling cornered but also not feeling particularly vulnerable given the fact that America couldn't recruit any of our friends to our new anti Iran campaign they hit back against oil tankers American drones Saudi pipelines we now seem perpetually on the precipice of war with Iran and meanwhile they've restarted parts of their shuttered nuclear program we haven't convinced a single nation to help us build new sanctions and there's absolutely no chance that Trump is going to secure a better deal than the JC before he leaves office in just over a year Iran is a bigger Menace than before he took office they just scored another major victory with Trump's abandonment of the Kurds and the anti Iran coalition that the United States methodically built under Barack Obama has vanished perhaps never again to be resurrected now in this very red region of the world right now the only leader who's been happy with Trump's dangerous bizarre non strategy on Iran has been Benjamin Netanyahu but he may not be in power much longer than his alliance with Trump has left his successor a frightening legacy under Trump's watch the two-state solution in Israel a longtime bipartisan linchpin of American policy in the Middle East has effectively fallen apart Trump has allowed Israel to take steps that make a future Palestinian state almost impossible and for three years he's put his son-in-law whose only experience was using his father's money to buy real estate in charge of brokering peace between Israel and the Palestinians it was a joke everybody knew it but since Trump was president everybody had to play along now there's no peace plan there was never gonna be a peace plan and the chances for one are almost non-existent after three years of the Trump administration now down in Libya Trump admittedly inherited a pretty miserable situation but somehow like everything else he managed to make it worse the country's been fractured for years as rival militias with a host of foreign patrons have been fighting a civil war that's created a vacuum that's been filled in by extremists and a migrant crisis that continues to expand but instead of doing the hard work of diplomacy to try to get the warring parties back to the table instead Trump through his support his personal support behind a general heft are appending years of American diplomacy and endorsing after his plan to try to take Tripoli by force as a result the fighting there continues peace talks are failing and the humanitarian crisis grows by the now one of the consequences of this Trump death spiral in Libya and the Middle East is that the economic and political refugees continue to flow into Europe which simply isn't politically ready to accept this rate of inflow and by slashing the number of refugees allowed to the United States from over a hundred thousand to 18,000 we've communicated to the Europeans that we have no interest in helping just like everything else Trump has made the assimilation of Muslim immigrants into Europe even harder by serving as a model for racist xenophobic demagogues and right-wing nationalist political parties who want to bring Trump's form of political nativism into Europe nationalist political parties are on the rise all across the West and Trump is absolutely central to their development he gravitates not towards Angela Angela Merkel whose courageous leadership has held the EU together through all of these crises but he hews to Viktor Orban who's stoked the embers of nationalism to take Hungary down a dark path Trump in his nationalist compatriots they weaponized these fears of immigration cultural change to justify really bad policies from labeling journalists as enemies of the state to putting kids in cages and when right-wing groups try to copy Trump success and deploy his PlayBook in countries all throughout Europe he doesn't stand up and object as the leader of the free world should he offers a wink and a nod sometimes a warm embrace the Trump doesn't stop there in his deliberate attempts to undermine European democracy he's carried out a systematic purposeful campaign to weaken the European Union and NATO by now we've kind of all grown used to Trump's attacks on globalism but it is still pretty extraordinary that we have a president who doesn't just attack the specific institutions he loathes like the UN or the EU or NATO he levels regular broadsides against the entire concept of global cooperation he sees multilateralism as weakness and his cheerleading of Britain out the door of the EU and his constant attacks on NATO even the point of wondering out loud whether the United States would actually defend NATO allies if attacks it risks taking down the entire post-world war two order that would be a disaster for us if NATO fell apart and a gift to countries like China and Russia and India and non-state actors like al-qaeda and Isis now of course when it comes to our relations with Europe Trump reserves his greatest multilateral Animus for global attempts to address climate change the Paris agreement wasn't even a binding commitment on the United States but Trump felt so strongly that climate change was a hoax unwind that riddle for me that he pulled us out of the agreement in a big grand festive ceremony at the White House now global climate catastrophe is coming if we don't do anything in fact it's already here the story back to Syria for a minute of their descent into madness can partially be told through the tale of successive global warming connected droughts that forced farmers into overcrowded cities that weren't ready for those population surges Trump's hostility to climate action is one of his most unforgivable global legacies and the next president may not have enough time or enough political capital to try to make up the ground that we've lost on climate change especially with our European partners speaking of failure to capitalize up opportunity let's spin the globe back to our hemisphere where according to the script things couldn't be going much worse here in the America is everything that Trump has touched thus far has fallen apart and the u.s. is weaker regionally than ever before Trump's nativism it's his political calling card but his own policies seemed to encourage more migration to the United States not less of it president Trump's decision to cut off foreign assistance to Central American countries because they weren't doing enough to stop migration is lunacy President Obama's program of investing in Central American security so that less of their citizens feel the need to flee to America it was beginning to work and Trump gave it all away simply to provide fuel to his domestic political agenda further south us Venezuela policy is one of the few times that Trump's presidency stood up to a dictator unfortunately because Trump doesn't know how to do foreign policy he botched that intervention too it's been really embarrassing to watch this administration repeatedly and wrongly claim that the Maduro regime is on the verge of collapse they did it in January when Juan Y dos swore himself in is interim president they did it again in February when they said deploying American aid along the border would trigger the regime's fall and they did it again in April in the lead up to a military uprising that went nowhere the White House is regular engaged in tough talk on Venezuela only to see Maduro s-- hold on power and or trump played all his cards on this crisis right in the first few days like a nervous teenager and now we're left sanctioning the Venezuelan people and recognizing a leader of a country who isn't really the leader of that country and probably isn't ever going to be the leader of that country it's yet another failure that makes us just look weak and foolish we make a play and then we can't back it up it's hard to be scared of the United States these days when everything we try to do goes wrong let's move back over to the African continent for a moment now as a candidate Trump repeatedly stoke fears of the Ebola epidemic in western Africa wildly tweeting that the United States must immediately stop all flights from Ebola infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our borders and of course this didn't make any sense and it doesn't make any sense now we've known for ages that travel bans aren't actually the best way to deal with an outbreak of disease but since he's become president the Trump administration has asked Congress to rescind 252 million dollars that had been put aside to deal with the virus he out stood the NSA's top bio defense expert and repeatedly sought to slash funding for global health programs sadly Trump's default response to epidemics characterized by barriers and exclusion defunding of preventive measures it only hurts our ability to control outbreaks that are present today and in the future and finally Denmark Trump managed to even screw up our relationship with Denmark which many of us would have thought was impossible out of an episode of The Simpsons Trump canceled the diplomatic meeting with Denmark's leader because they wouldn't agree to sell us Greenland now it sounds funny but it's an example of the relatively small things compared to all the big world-changing screw-ups that happen almost every day in this president's foreign policy they'd only get a few days of media attention I mean Denmark's one of our strongest NATO allies at the height of the war in Afghanistan they had one of the highest numbers of troops per capita fighting alongside us they hold the key to blocking a Russian gas pipeline that could avoid Ukraine damaging their economy and come into Europe but now we've managed to even make Denmark an adversary I know it sounds implausible but this is just the tip of the iceberg it's a policy Massacre everywhere the world is on fire and in most places Trump is one of the arsonists and meanwhile who's benefiting across the board America's enemies and our competitors they are rubbing their hands with delight as we score own goal after own goal Putin gar de Juan Kim the hardliners in Iran they could not have scripted a better opportunity for themselves to gain power and influence at our expense I say that Trump's foreign policy is a global joke but calling what he does policy is probably unfair he doesn't really care to take the time to learn about the world he doesn't read his briefings he makes it up day by day with his personal political priorities his jealousies his headline addiction guiding his decisions rather than anything connected to our actual national security interests our foreign policy is in complete utter total meltdown and it's time for all of us to face facts now you can't impeach a president because you disagree with their policy but this is beyond a policy disagreement this is a president who has compromised our nation's integrity and our credibility who is put in jeopardy the safety of our citizens especially this week as Isis breaks out of detainment and looks to regroup to threaten America again in Syria these kind of things the perversion of the powers of the presidency they're not allowed in a democracy and our refusal to accept this kind of behavior it's what separates us from all of the tin-pot dictatorships around the world I hope eventually that my Republican colleagues see this but I also want my Republican colleagues who spend their time thinking of themselves as bulwarks of national security to see the damage much of it irreparable the Trump is doing to our position in the world why continue to offer him this unconditional protection from an impeachment inquiry if the cost of him staying in office is the shattering of our reputation around the world why continue to defend him if his actions everywhere are calling are causing the world to fall apart and it is falling apart in every part of the globe everything that this administration has touched has gotten worse and here's the scariest part this president and this administration still has 14 more months to do even more damage I yield the floor

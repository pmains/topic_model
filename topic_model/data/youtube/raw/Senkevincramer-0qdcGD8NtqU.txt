thank you mr chairman for for having this markup and before i state what my amendment does i i really want to take the opportunity to provide some background on the enormous frustration that the people of north dakota have had with the fish and wildlife service okay put simply the fish and wildlife service is the textbook example of an intransigent bureaucracy which is more interested in its own self-interests than the interests of the uh the citizens of this country frankly more interested in their self-interest than they are in in their their mission since i came to congress in 2013 i have heard not from a few not from dozens literally hundreds hundreds of landowners in north dakota who have had nothing but bad experiences with the fish and wildlife service under every type of administration their experience has been disastrous they've had their private property rights trampled on their personal rights trampled on they've had their their personal safety trampled on by gun-toting bulletproof vest wearing you know swat teams they're really biologists pretending to be tough guys and uh and their livelihoods and one in some cases literally driven to bankruptcy by zealots in the fish and wildlife service in other words i have very little faith in the fish and wildlife service in an attempt to work with them i have voted for republicans and democrats uh in the department of interior uh to include fish and wildlife service directors and under secretaries and deputy secretaries and so this brings us today to this you know bill and um this recovery in america's wildlife action is a bill that i was an original co-sponsor of along with 16 16 democrats and 15 other republicans i got on this bill because it sent funding to state i emphasize state fish and wildlife agencies to proactively and like stress proactively address and keep species off i stress off the endangered species act lists should be the goal of every conservationist in the world it's instead we see we see from our federal bureaucracy and and and some of their stakeholders this desire to keep critters on the endangered species list never have never understood it so when senator blunt and heinrich brought this to me i said this makes sense it emphasizes what state what's on what states can do and and and they're more more responsive to their constituents more nimble frankly they're more attuned to um the situation in front of them instead and this mr chairman's wife voted no on this on the substitute that creates the bill that's in front of us it reduces the money going to states and instead shifts it over to the very people who say if you just give us more money we can do better for you just give us more money and we can respond in a in a faster way forgive my skepticism and the skepticism of the people of north dakota but i am so tired of bureaucrats who say if you just give us more we could help the landowners more i don't care how fast they do it or how slowly they do it the outcome's never right i have yet to have an appeal for example on a waterfall production area appeal ever go the landowner's way not under the previous administration in fact under this administration literally um dozens of of appeals have never been acted on in fact a letter sent by farmers over a year ago to the director has never even been returned has never been responded to so i don't see how giving them more money to not work helps my landowners so with that again i want to applaud senators heinrich and blunt and and the people that got on this bill and made it a very very good bill before today but this isn't this is not that bill so my amendment's simple it simply strips the substitute returns the bill to its original form which is what i and many others on the committee signed to and i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting my amendment to remove the substitute return the bill and to its evenly bipartisan form with that i yield and thank

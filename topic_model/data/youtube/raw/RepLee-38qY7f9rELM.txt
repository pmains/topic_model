former food stamp recipient myself and public assistance recipient I know firsthand just how important these safety net programs are I would not be here today if it were not for that lifeline that bridge over troubled water that these types of programs extended to me when I was a single mother on welfare raising two amazing sons trying to get my life together so that I could move on and take care of my family and live the American dream believe me I know no one wants to be on food stamps no one everyone wants a good paying job that allows them to provide for their family and contribute to society they want to take care of their kids their bumps in the road yes and now the economy has turned around for many but not for all so that bridge over troubled waters found more than ever so I hope that in the negotiations in this omnibus bill we're going to make sure we remember these people and not raid the programs that keep people out of poverty provide a safety net and as mr. Hoyer said let's do no harm in this bill and let's help people move into the middle class

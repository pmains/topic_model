uh thank you um i'm chair uh look we've heard a lot of criticism uh today of the trump uh strategy uh but i wanna remind people that on september 16th the states were given a 57 page guidance document 57 pages uh in how to set up a program and they were asked to respond by october the 16th just a month later so if for people to say there are no plans that just means this stage didn't create one that works uh so for those of you that can't resist this temptation to criticize the former administration and even going so far as to say that the body administration uh was starting from scratch and there was no national strategy dr fauci has refuted that very clearly so take a deep breath look operation warp speed created the vaccine the state it's the job of the state to put it in people's arms but it seems that states can't even get that right here's a here's a chart unfortunately that the majority party uh had rules that we had to submit this 24 hours prior to this but this chart indicates that there were some states that can't get it right as some of you some states have been complaining they need more vaccines but have only given out more than 50 percent look at illinois illinois vaccination rate is half of what it is in alaska at 8.3 people per 100 but alaska is 16.8 or west virginia is almost 15 per 100 and illinois 8 colorado 10 michigan 10 but then they don't they're not using it that their their use of their vaccine in illinois is only 62 as compared to north dakota 91 so apparently they didn't develop a plan that it was flexible enough to work so uh i i i'm just concerned about that unlike new york and that's a key thing unlike new york's governor which who ignored their the vulnerable in their long-term facilities and recommendations of his public health experts west virginia prioritized its long-term care residents and their staff west virginia also finished vaccinating all their long-term care facilities and staff meanwhile states like michigan won't even won't finish until the end of this month so interestingly enough no one has give and no one really i think has given proper attention to operation warp speed remember dr fauci testified before the senate committee last in may of last year that it would take a year to 18 months before a vaccine can be developed think about that a year and 18 months in may but through the hard work of the pharmaceutical companies researchers and scientists a vaccine was available in december just seven months later so just seven months after the creation of warp speed we had a vaccine so i guess but what i want you all to take away is complaining about not getting that vaccine is like complaining about the size of your meal and you should be grateful to having food on the table so dr marsh uh i'd like to turn to you and just in in the remaining time that we have here can you expound just a little bit more about what what was the magic in in west virginia be not only having it at a rate of 15 1500 vaccination rate but also at home is at 87 88 uh percent used of the vaccine what what what can we say to the other states how they can improve on that well thank you congressman um ultimately west virginia made a plan that worked for us and it was really a matter and we've talked about this at this testimony it's a matter of clear communication breaking down parallelisms and sectors everybody wore the same hat we were operating for a higher purpose and as we go forward we constantly iterate it and are iterating our our approach so that we are moving in the most expeditious and quick way possible i just want to reinforce one thing that the congressman said as well and and i say this as a in a political way as i can the fact that we have these vaccines are game changers this is the most complex you know problematic response probably in the history of modern day america and the world and so staying together and working together and sharing with each other best practices is really key for our global and country success thank you thank you back

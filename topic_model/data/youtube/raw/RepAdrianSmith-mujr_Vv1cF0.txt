thank you jack thank you to all of you uh paul and robert obviously this is important stuff uh and your work on on uh getting people to work it just cannot be overstated how important it is and work requirements and your point on upward mobility we we should never even think about a program without upward mobility in mind in that exit out of poverty and out of a government dependency um i hear a lot of concerns about kind of the cliff basically whether it's employers or beneficiaries themselves and that that cliff effect that does have an impact uh what would be just briefly some ideas perhaps for getting us um beyond that so that it is not viewed as the obstacle that so many view it i'll give you just a 30 second answer with digital technology these days the ability to program money um i think you can consolidate benefits an algorithmically adjusted per person so that she needs transportation she needs housing assistance and nutrition and then just supplemental income you can you can phase the benefit out as she rises in a way that it always makes sense to take that step forward so the the problem we had in government is you couldn't customize benefits now with data and digital technology we can customize benefits and get rid of a bunch of bureaucracy in the meantime that's what i mean okay thank you robert it's a combination of consolidating the other programs so that people can can can receive the aid in a way that that makes sense and doesn't take them around around town to various programs and leveling off the uh the the the benefit as earnings rise so that they lose some benefit because these are means-tested programs but they don't lose more benefits than they are gaining in earnings and then we this is a complicated difficult top topic but one which technology can solve and that's the sort of work we should be doing not what the democrats are proposing very good thank you are you back

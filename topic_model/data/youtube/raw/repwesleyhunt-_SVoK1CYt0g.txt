[Music] Happy New Year I'm Greg Grugan in Houston I'm Stephen dial in Dallas and I'm Rudy Koski and Austin and this is Texas the issue is this week in the nation's capital elected lawmakers old and new have gathered for a fresh session of a now divided Congress among them Wesley hunt a trump-backing Houston area conservative many of you as a rising star in the Texas Republican delegation newly elected Republican Congressman Wesley hunt insists the deepening immigration crisis along the Texas border is a clear and present danger to America's sovereignty and security two and a half million people last year about four and a half million people total that we know of enough fentanyl has poured into this country to kill every American five times this is flat out Un-American and what we can do in the house is make sure that we fund our border security agents we actually build a wall and actually Implement other parts of border security and actually take this seriously hunt a former U.S army combat helicopter pilot is joining other GOP lawmakers who label the Mexican cartels and existential threat we have usurped that power to that entity to basically a terrorist group and we in the house have got to make sure that we take control of our border this is a Sovereign Nation we need to know exactly who is coming in and out of our country it's our constitutional right and we must implement it a veteran of the Texas oil patch hunt has pledged to push back on President Biden's anti-carbon policies nobody is against renewable energy we actually want to get to that next abundant and affordable clean energy source but you cannot get there without LNG you cannot get there without oil we have got to stop the assault on our number one industry not just in Houston but in our state there's also an issue of National Security when we wage war against our own industry we only Empower China we Empower Russia we Empire Iran and other Rogue Nations and we have got to make sure that we are the ones that can supply our own country and our allies with good clean LNG fossil fuel oil you name it because everything that we use is a byproduct of oil and energy we've got to get this right and we have an opportunity to do that in the 118th Congress hunt says in the newly formed 38th congressional district inflation is ravaging family budgets and he blames profligate government spending by Joe Biden and Democrats and our inflation continues to spike and it's only going to get worse with its disastrous policies that we've seen for divine Administration and if you think a 1.7 trillion dollar bill that just got passed last week is going to remedy this problem you are sorely mistaken as for who Republicans should choose in their quest to regain the White House hunt his siding with the former president that's what we have primaries for we have to let this cake bake we'll see how it all shakes out but right now A milk's primary voters president Trump is up around 20 points and we'll see how this whole thing shakes out but I got a pretty confident feeling that it's going to remain that way especially in the Republican primary with his first days beneath the capitol Dome immersed in the contentious battle to lead the slim Republican house majority hunt says he's completely undaunted this is how our system works sometimes democracy is messy but by God this is the best system in the entire world and as somebody that's lived in Saudi Arabia and flew combat missions in Iraq I can tell you that the last few days while frustrating is better than anywhere else in the entire world

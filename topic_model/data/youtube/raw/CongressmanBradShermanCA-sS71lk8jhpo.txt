we could stop this we could go right now to those on the floor and demand that the rule be changed and we make in order and protect an amendment to the foreign ops approps bill in the defense of Propst bill pending on the floor today requiring and and and we could require that any transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia or the Emirates get an affirmative vote by Congress we could at been a minimum just repudiate this phony declaration of emergency and so I'll yield to any Republican member that wants to join me in that effort as you see Congress is divided you have defeated your enemy the now this declaration of emergency is bogus a court may very well decide that in a few years and if this one isn't you can imagine that at some future time there would be a bogus declaration is there any personal liability that anybody in the executive branch faces if they just decide to ignore the arms Export Control Act or come up with absurd definitions designed to claim to be adhering to it when a court would determine that they had violated can you basically do anything you want as long as you can say it with a straight face there's a practical matter or do you face or do you or anyone else in the administration face any in any civil or criminal liability yes please limit your answer to that Thank You congressman Sherman so no the short answer is no we're in compliance with statute well let's say that in some future decision you were not in compliance with statute because we don't would you face any liability or can you violate the statute with impunity should you or your success or choose to do so I'm not aware of anybody regardless of branch of government being able to violate statute but what is the what is the outcome if some successor of yours decides to violate the statute I'm not gonna get it I'm gonna focus on what I would vote you had legal advice on this yes as as extreme as this administration is it is quite possible that a court would determine that you folks have gone too far that you violated the law that there is not a good-faith emergency and that those involved are deliberately intentionally violating the arms Export Control Act Congress irma the single appliance with the arms export you think you're complying many of us do not and who knows what the determination of some future tribunal or Court would be we have swung very far in the direction of presidential power so the the the question here it appears as if you've determined that the emergency is that Congress won't agree with you no sir well you told us that you wanted to do we didn't approve and so you declared an emergency if Congress had promptly agreed with your plans would there be an emergency yes so an emergency or conditions based and I'm glad you asked that question congressman Sherman the conditions that we've discussed here today and we can discuss further in another fora not only were the threat streams emanating from Tehran there were the conditions of the readiness of our partners ensuring our partners that we stand with them and then they're also the conditions of looking at near-peer adversaries looking for all right so you decided that whatever policy you want to carry out must be carried out and that anything that prevents you from doing it even for a short time constitutes an emergency please read the Constitution I yield back thank you sir I've been

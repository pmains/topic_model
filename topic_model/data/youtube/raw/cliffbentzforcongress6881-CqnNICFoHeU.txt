[Applause] so we got a question via Facebook last night how about cliff sponsoring the sage-grouse habitat restoration bill which I'm not sure exactly which bill that is but does that represent CD 2 values yeah well so whoever asked that question apparently hadn't been involved in the sage-grouse Wars but the the sage-grouse is not necessarily an endangered species but it's a threatened one and so there's been a organized attempt to try to not have a repeat of the spotted owl situation and suddenly having all of the ranchers in huge parts of Oregon precluded from turning their cattle out and so the question has been how do we make sure we don't have those grouse move over into the endangered space and suddenly people that lose huge parts of where they used to graze are Katherine we don't want that to happen and so I've been working with ranchers with the Cattlemen's Association and this is one of the reasons the cattle Association has endorsed me because I worked so closely with them to try to address issues as challenging as the sage-grouse I don't remember that exact bill but I did a number of bills in that space the thing I'm happiest about is I was able to convince the or oh well watershed enhancement Board made a lot of garden to allocate 10 million dollars a million dollars a year over ten years to exactly that trying to restore areas where the sage-grouse are and the concept is let's make sure these birds do not become endangered and we suddenly can't turn a lot anymore I mean that's what we're trying to do and so if you if you just turn a blind eye to this and say too bad for the grass then you're basically saying too bad for the cattle and so frankly I support the cattlemen and so I've worked very closely I don't know how many sage-grouse meetings I've gone to the cattlemen have worked incredibly closely everybody's been working closely to try to figure out how to to manage this really challenging situation while we're still able to graze cattle and it's been a lot of hard work so I would encourage whoever asked that question to go through the research and figure out where where they [Applause] [Music]

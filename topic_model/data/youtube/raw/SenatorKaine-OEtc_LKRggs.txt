mr. president I rise today in support of the Affordable Care Act and to discuss the devastating impact its potential elimination would have on rural families and rural communities my state Virginia has so many rural communities and in that I am with every other member of this body and I want to talk specifically about them the Trump administration has sought for years to end the Affordable Care Act using every tool available they've worked on their front on that task here in Congress to repeal it sabotage it and even dismantle it in the court system and today marks another milestone in that deeply troubling effort the fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety if the ACA were struck down families and communities around the country would bear life-altering consequences and the health care system would be thrown into chaos tens of millions of Americans would lose health care coverage and protections for pre-existing conditions among the countless other consumer protections have been put in place by the ACA a number of my colleagues are going to be on the floor this afternoon speaking about particular aspects of this the trouble them I want to focus on one in particular how important the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is to rural America and how much is at stake for those communities should the ACA be eliminated Medicaid expansion enables low-income rural residents to get affordable quality health insurance so they can get the care they need it is often the case that insurance companies do not compete in the same intensity in rural communities because there's just not enough patients and so it's common in rural America for somebody wanting to buy an insurance policy on the exchange for example to maybe only have one option and so Medicaid expansion has turned out to be a huge benefit for many low-income people living in rural America many of those who are receiving insurance pursuant to Medicaid expansion have been previously uninsured and so for some it's the first insurance that they've had in their life a particular impact of Medicaid expansion has not just been on individuals receiving that Medicaid but on the hospitals that are sort of the healthcare and even economic pillars in rural communities rural hospitals often have a difficult time making the finances work again lower patient volumes makes it difficult but Medicaid expansion has meant that care that they've been providing that in the past might not have been reimbursed at all they're able to get at least a Medicaid reimbursement and that has meant a significant significant financial benefit to these hospitals mr. president you understand this because your state is like mine where there's a lot of rural communities rural hospitals are often the lifeblood of rural communities they they can be the largest employers in a town or or a county they're often places that do not just within the hospital walls but a tremendous amount of outreach outside the hospital walls on health care and other philanthropic you know sponsoring the Little League teams and doing the things that make a community a community so residents of rural communities need access to health care but they also need access to jobs and good health care information rural hospitals provide them I've seen the impact of rural hospital closures in Virginia firsthand two rural hospitals in Virginia closed in recent years because Virginia did not expand Medicaid initially in the last year Virginia has a Medicaid expansion but before Medicaid expansion was done we saw hospitals closed in two communities in Virginia Patrick County which is a Southside Virginia County that that is on the border with North Carolina and Lee County which is a far southwestern Virginia County that's on the border of Kentucky County and Kentucky and Tennessee and two hospitals have closed in those communities I got a letter from a mother in Christiansburg Virginia which is actually up near Virginia Tech her name is Robin and she wrote about the closure of the Pioneer hospital in Patrick County in 2017 she wrote this my mother who recently turned 70 still lives in Patrick County and we're approaching the point of either the family having to move back to Patrick County to be near her or moving my mother the Christiansburg where we currently live my son has severe food allergies that could lead to anaphylactic shock which would require me to mediate medical attention so this variable also weighs very heavily on my mind when considering the options of how to manage my family's land and take care of my mom I don't want to live somewhere without access to emergency healthcare it seems inconceivable that this is the case in the era in which we live now please help get my home County back on the medical map to give its economy and its people a fighting chance so Blacksburg is probably hour and a half to two hours away mother living in a County that now has no hospital she's turning 70 so she doesn't have access to care that she needs daughter trying to decide do I move back but I've got a son who needs care because of allergies do I have to move my mother out of the home where she would rather stay rural hospitals across the country are struggling to keep their doors open for a number of reasons but here is an amazing set of statistics whether a state expands Medicaid pursuant to the ACA is a massively significant factor in rural hospitals financial outlook and decision making without Medicaid expansion rural hospitals may be forced to cut vital services or even to close here's the data point that really says it all since January of 2010 a hundred and seven rural hospitals have closed in the United States ninety three of those 107 hospitals were in states that had not expanded met at the time of the closure hundreds more rural hospitals are at risk of closure rural hospital closures disproportionately occur in states that have not expanded Medicaid the success of the Texas case would wipe out the ACA including Medicaid expansion and deeply penalize these rural hospitals a comprehensive 2018 study and Health Affairs found that Medicaid expansion is associated with directly associated with hospital financial performance and that expansion substantially reduces the risk of hospital closure particularly in rural areas the study also found that going back to pre ACA eligibility for Medicaid would drive even more rural hospitals to closure so we think about Robins dilemma a mother living in a rural area where the hospital is closed if the ACA is struck down and there's no Medicaid expansion this is going to be faced by more and more and more rural communities across the country and then that means this is a dilemma that's ultimately faced by individuals and their families research from Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute indicates that the uninsured rate for low-income adults in rural communities fell three times as fast in states that expanded Medicaid as compared to states that did not expand turn that around states that expand Medicaid find that rural families have a dramatically higher likelihood of having insurance than those in rural areas where the states have an expanded Medicaid as of now thirty-six states including Virginia have expanded Medicaid 14 if not I'm thrilled that earlier this year Virginia after a multi-year battle finally announced that Medicaid expansion was happening and in less than a year after expansion nearly two hundred and ninety three thousand adults are newly enrolled in Medicaid in Virginia many of whom never had health insurance before in their life 293 thousand adults in a state where the population is about eight and a half million that is a sick sniffing at number of people who have received insurance through Medicaid expansion they risk losing their eligibility if the administration is successful in its efforts to get the ACA if we care about rural residents and rural communities there's a number of things we can do first we we need to stand up against the administration's attempt to end the ACA including its Medicaid expansion I have now been in public life for 25 years since I was elected to the Richmond City Council in May of 1994 I will say in all the elections I've been in up or down and all the various legislative and other battles the single most romantic moment in my life as an elected official was standing on the floor of this body at two o'clock in the morning when Senator John McCain fresh out of a hospital being diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumor cast the deciding vote and by one vote by one vote we save the Affordable Care Act I've never in my life experienced in the public realm something that was so dramatic and so consequential we have to continue to stand up i I would have thought that that vote might have moved us to a new chapter where we're talking about fixing and improving rather than about repealing but that's not the case as evidenced by the lawsuit today but my hope is that we will resist efforts to sabotage and destroy and instead join together in efforts to improve I've joined with my colleagues to co-sponsor a resolution allowing the Senate legal counsel to intervene in the lawsuit to defend the Affordable Care Act the second thing we can do to help rural communities is focus on the 14 states that haven't yet expanded Medicaid and provide them a clear path and an encouragement to do so I'm proud to be an original co-sponsor of something called the same Act which would extend the same level of federal assistance to every state that chooses to expand Medicaid regardless of when the expansion occurs and I think that's important let's use the original Medicaid program as an example was passed in 1865 the land it was not a mandate it was it was an option the last state Arizona State 50 that join didn't join till 1982 so there was a 17 year period between when the first state joined into the then voluntary Medicaid program and when the last state did let's make sure that whenever states joined they're treated the same if this bill passes states that choose to expand now these 14 states would make sure that they get the full federal level of assistance as was available to those states that initially joined and that should help remaining States get off the sidelines finally we need to stand up against administrative sabotage of the Affordable Care Act we shouldn't promote skimpy insurance plans we shouldn't slash funding for enrollment for outreach for marketing we should build on and improve and yes fix because it's not perfect fix the ACA to extend its promise of affordable coverage to even more Americans that's why I have introduced Medicare acts legislation to establish a public insurance plan that could be offered on the ACA exchanges beginning in rural areas my bill would also make the ACA stacks credits more generous expand tax credit eligibility to additional families and allow for an enhanced reimbursement rate in rural communities where low patient volumes often post financial challenges to health care providers in closing the ACA has meant the difference between life and death for many families across the country and I run into them every day I'm going to be standing with some Senate colleagues on the steps of the Senate and in a few minutes talking about a youngster from Winchester Virginia who has a series of significant health care challenges that would essentially in the past have made him uninsurable because of a pre-existing condition but who now because of that protection within the ACA he and his family at least have the peace of mind of knowing that he can't be kicked off insurance or turned down for insurance because he happened to be born with a condition over which he had no control if the ACA were to be struck down families and communities would suffer and I think in Virginia that would particularly be the case in our rural communities and again I'm just going to hold up this issue of our rural hospitals we need to protect rural hospitals not only because of the health care they provide but because they are employment centers and centers of community outreach and when we see the closure of rural hospitals overwhelmingly being in states that have not expanded Medicaid that tells us how valuable that portion of the ACA has been to stabilize the provision of rural health care I will continue to fight to protect the ACA in the health of my rural communities in Virginia and elsewhere and I encourage my colleagues to do the same with that mr. president I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum

good morning madam chair thank you um for having this hearing and and this is another topic madam chair where you and i i think share a lot of objectives we've spent a lot of time talking about resiliency and adaptation of our respective coastal states and coastal districts and the importance of making investments there being from south louisiana we've had 90 percent of the coastal wetlands loss in the continental united states which does make our communities more vulnerable to hurricanes and sea rise and other other challenges related to sustainability um this one energy efficiency look if we can if we can reduce the consumption of energy and things that we're doing and whether it's in our business it's driving vehicles it's uh manufacturing then that helps improve the competitiveness competitiveness of the united states energy efficiency energy conservation efforts are absolutely critical um in in our long-term objectives here and and it's a no regrets approach because it allows us to reduce the the cost of utility bills for consumers that are struggling with their ability to to pay those bills today it helps to reduce the cost of fueling vehicles in order to get to work or uh or go to school or spend time with family those are all win wins and those are no regrets it improves the competitiveness of the united states but madam chair i think something that that's really important to keep in mind as well is the international perspective here um you're right ipcc did release a new uh report uh last week and and um it's it's interesting because what's happened with ukraine has has sort of made i think a lot of people realize uh the united states is is one country in a very large global community and you have people that operate by different standards and we often find ourselves trying to apply american values american ethics american standards to other countries i think vladimir putin feels about that how do you think he feels about america's values our standards look at what he's doing he's he's completely just rolling over people no respect for human rights no respect for sovereignty yet he's going to be a partner in climate change not a chance in hell what about what about uh president xi and china you you think looking at what they're doing with slave labor in child labor uh the way that they completely abuse abused the uyghurs and human rights do you really think that china is going to have any respect for human rights china has released four tons of emissions increased four tons of emissions for every one ton we've reduced i think that we're looking at ourselves a a a little bit more um as a bit more inflated than we really are we're not going to be able to solve this issue on our own let me say it again china has increased emissions four tons for every one ton of emissions we've reduced that's moving in the wrong direction globally yet we're sitting here talking about spending not millions not hundreds of millions not billions tens of billions and hundreds of billions of dollars to try to save the planet whenever we've got other international actors that don't care they don't care let me read you something energy president biden's energy plan is going to result in higher electricity prices higher prices at the gas pump lost revenue sharing for hurricane protection flood control and coastal restoration higher delivery costs meaning delivery of groceries and all products more dependence on foreign energy from china russia iran and other countries and a net increase in global emissions madam chair all of those things let me run through again higher electricity prices check we're seeing it higher prices at the gas pump check we're seeing it lost revenue because as a result of not doing lease sales the first president in modern history to not do energy lease sales we're losing revenue the united states treasury's losing revenue which means because we have revenue sharing for offshore energy production my home state one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever make landfall hurricane ida we're not getting the revenues that we should have to to build hurricane protection and restoring our coastal ecosystem and other projects flood control so so that one we've realized higher delivery cost uh with inflation and supply chain we're getting higher costs there more dependence on foreign energy from china russia and others we're seeing that a net increase in global emissions we've seen that this is a statement that i made on january 27th of last year madam chair i am all four i am all for the objectives that you've stated but we have got to have a strategy that is actually global looking in nature and one that truly achieves the objectives not one that just thrusts costs on the united states taxpayers and makes energy unaffordable and doesn't achieve what i believe are our common environmental goals

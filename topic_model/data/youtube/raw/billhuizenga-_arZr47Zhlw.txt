mr hazinger and uh and turn it over to him thank you appreciate that and i know you've all seen this card right and it's just kind of viewed as maybe a partisan response but you're just hearing now that this is not partisan uh this is this is a high priority for the republicans as we're coming up with what we believe are truly things that will be america's job help create jobs here in america but i'll give you another story about that um my my former governor in michigan jim blanchard democrat democrat governor who went on to be the ambassador to canada who sits on the board of a competitor transcanada enbridge is also supporting this and they understand that this transcends politics it transcends uh business this is truly about north american energy security and frankly the american people don't care they don't care whether it's enbridge transcanada or any other firm or any other party it's about hard-working taxpayers those moms and those dads that have to go and put fuel in their minivans and in their cars and in their trucks and have to take care of business back home and make sure that those those budgets balance at the kitchen table we can't seem to do that here in washington our states have to do it they have to do it but they understand in their heart of hearts that when they do this we are going to be able to lower those prices at the pump we're going to be able to bring more energy here to the united states and i frankly i think it was uh it was a it was a shame that the president uh didn't hold up that mirror to himself in his in his words during the state of the union where he was talking about making sure that we have secure energy sources making sure that those energy sources come from friendlies and rather than our enemies and there is no greater friend in the united states than canada and none who is going to care about the environment more and guess what this oil is coming out of the ground in canada and it's going one of two directions it's either going to go south and go through places like montana and nebraska where they have worked out a new route and go down to the gulf guess what it's also going to come to michigan and a number of other places along the way or it's going to end up going to china and i want that that energy fueling our recovery not the chinese economy so thanks and i apologize

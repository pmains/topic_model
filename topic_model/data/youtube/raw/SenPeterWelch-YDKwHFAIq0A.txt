thank you I thank the panel and thank to chairman and thank my colleagues this is such a great issue you know such we can do something useful for once in the energy storage industry is it's a big deal in Vermont I just want to talk a little bit about that then ask a few questions in Vermont we're starting to see what it could look like when our largest utility Green Mountain Power is all in on this they have a energy storage resource including Strafford Hill Stafford Hill solar in storage facility in Rutland it's one of the first micro grids powered solely by solar and battery backup and it was the first in the region to use battery storage to reduce peak power usage saving $200,000 in one hour in Vermont that's like real money the battery storage can also be used to power an emergency shelter at the Rutland High School in 2015 GMP launched its first of a kind program to offer 500 Tesla Power Ball batteries for 3750 per month a deal that included customers getting backup power for letting the utilities tap the batteries to manage system-wide or local peak conditions in that's so terrific because we don't have to have these big backup generators and we had a first-hand look at what happened we had a big heat wave in July and by leveraging these batteries and demand response resources GMP was able to take the equivalent of 5,000 homes off the grid saving customers about $500,000 and we've got a couple of others dinah power in Waterbury I'm interested to learn more about what we can do to build off this type of work and I want to talk about FERC order 841 that came out earlier earlier this year and as you know that move moves towards opening the US wholesale energy markets to storage putting storage on an equal footing with generators and other grid resources so I want to ask mister uh mister frigo does FERC order 841 solve all your industry's problems or what other barriers are there and do current market designs adequately value and compensate storage for the flexibility it provides to the grid and what in your view needs to be done right FERC order 841 is a great great start but as my colleagues have mentioned I think the the big push now is to to finalize that I know there's been a number of stakeholders that of VAS FERC for for rehearing on that I think it's important to deny that rain hearing and basically implement the order full-on that yeah if you just delay delaying the order you're right you're delaying the implementation thank you so the the then the then you also have for order 845 which is dealing with the interconnection push that for forward as well and I think I think actually another thing is is there has been a number of states this gets back to the fate a federal-state relationship there's been a number of states that have really pushed storage forward that I think the federal government could can learn from California's one New York is one and we've seen it recently with Massachusetts and and just recently in New Jersey as well there are things that these states are doing that could be adopted to the rest of the country thank you mr. mr. coos NAR what do you view is the main limitations of battery technology at this point and can you update the committee Committee on any new promising storage technologies that may address some of these limitations right and I think where storage technologies today is in a very good place you know we started doing R&D projects you know almost 10 years ago where it's come from there to now from a control system standpoint to reliability standpoint it's improved dramatically you know I think going forward you look at most technologies that are commercial available commercially available it lithium-ion the kind of the duration that they can you know they're they're finite and their duration so I think you know one thing as the utility we're always looking for is kind of longer duration batteries one that can meet more of our peak and that's something we're really keeping an eye on going one last question I introduced a bill that would extend the electric vehicle credit you know we're bump up against the 200,000 and mr. free go can you elaborate and how Eevee expansion can benefit storage sure so these batteries that we use for grid purposes weather generation or transmission and distribution are being manufactured in the same facilities as batteries for electric vehicles and electric vehicles is the bulk of that manufacturing capacity right now and so as as you as you provide incentives for more electric vehicles to be bought put on the road to be implemented obviously increases the demand for the manufacturing capacity which makes those battery providers expand that capacity driving costs down because you get economies of scale and then the grid applications for use of batteries just follows as a natural result okay thank you very much thank the panel mr. Chairman I yield back

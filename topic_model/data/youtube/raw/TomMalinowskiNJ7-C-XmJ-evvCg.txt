distance joining me now is congressman tom malinowski of new jersey congressman it's great to see you again thanks for coming back on the show uh you were born in poland uh which has received the largest number of ukrainian refugees by far tell me a little bit about how personal this is for you well i you know i look at these people and and they remind me um of my own family um the stories that my family told me about hiding from uh from germans and nazis in world war ii uh and you know we're seeing scenes that we we thought at least in europe had been banished forever and and obviously they were not um so now we got to do something about it and i'm proud that my country is helping the ukrainians fight this fight and i think ultimately win this fight but i'm also thinking about what happens um after the the fighting is over and hopefully the russians are driven uh out of of ukraine um we're going to have some choices to make about the sanctions that we've imposed and what to do with the assets the the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of russian assets that we have that we have frozen and and i'm just asking the simple question can can you imagine after all the harm that has been done that we would send russia's wealth back to putin um just for a ceasefire right i i can't imagine that not with ukraine laying in ruins yeah and you br you bring up a good point because your proposed legislation would actually seize certain russian assets valued over five million dollars and then redirect the funds to aid the ukrainian people tell me more how that would work and how it could turn putin's assets against him are you concerned at all that it may face legal challenges here in the united states by those oligarchs well it isn't legal now that's why we're trying to make it legal uh by by passing this bipartisan bill we'll have a vote on it in the foreign affairs committee in the house this week there is a bipartisan version of this bill that's been introduced in the senate as well under current law and and i think a lot of folks don't understand this under current law we can block we can freeze these assets but we can't actually seize them and i think under these extraordinary circumstances that this is an appropriate measure it would bring some measure of justice it would the resources would be very valuable of course a 600 million dollar yacht can pay for rebuilding a lot of uh of shattered apartment buildings and schools and hospitals in ukraine we're going to need those resources and again i just i i i can't imagine anybody at this point um being comfortable with just returning this immense wealth to putin and remember it belongs to him not to the oligarchs in a real sense returning that wealth to putin while ukraine plays in smoldering ruins yeah people have made the point that he has given them that wealth so technically at least people would say that they are beholden to him and his and their assets are beholden to putin um i know that congressman fear is rising in russia that brutal oppression and the rise of another potential iron curtain could lead to a brain drain from that country obviously there are people who are risking their lives to oppose vladimir putin nearly a quarter of a million russians may have already fled their country by some estimates you have been encouraging the biden administration to actually accept these russian refugees which you called the best and brightest people in russia you believe it is in our own national interests to quote make putin's loss our gain is that another way the u.s could turn putin's assets against him and are you getting some traction on that do you believe the administration and others in congress would welcome the idea of having these russians leaving their country come to the u.s i believe so yes and look we have to take care of the ukrainian refugees first but most of the ukrainians who are fleeing their country right now are women and children whose male relatives are still home fighting in ukraine most of them want to go back and our policy is designed to help them go back by helping the ukrainian military win this fight the tens of thousands of russians who are fleeing putin's totalitarianism people like that schoolteacher that we heard julia yaffi uh mention people who who are telling the truth who are resisting and who just cannot imagine living in this totalitarian dystopia for the next 10 or 20 years these are these are folks who are looking for permanent resettlement somewhere and and they are teachers they are scientists they are computer programmers they are inventors they are entrepreneurs these are people who um we'd be lucky to have them in the united states just as we were lucky to have refugees from communism and nazism in the 20th century these will be folks who uh will do great things for america help us become stronger in our competition with china over the next 50 years so i do think that that we should make an effort and i have spoken to the administration about making an effort to try to encourage them actually to settle in the united states all right congressman tom malinowski thank you so much for joining us greatly appreciate your time this evening

I would like to start by saying that although my friends across the aisle have accused the majority of a partisan witch hunt such accusations are completely unfounded the common adage is facts are stubborn things I contend that all one must do is to reflect onto the facts to know that this investigation is about asserting what happened so let's analyze the facts we know that Lois Lerner has a history of favoring liberal groups over conservative groups a bias there were multiple instances during her tenure at the Federal Elections Commission that show that and I'd like to place into the record an article outlining such of these instance without objection so ordered we have documents and emails from Lois Lerner with phrases like I'm really thinking we need to do a c4 project next year and we need to have a plan we need to be cautious so it isn't per se a political project we know the miss Lerner sent official IRS emails to her own official email account which is a violation of IRS rules we also know that she may have broken federal law by disclosing sensitive tax return information we know that she was heavily involved in the orchestration and disclosure of the information to the public about inappropriate tactics used by the IRS she wanted to avoid litigation that being disclosure form because as she put it if it goes to litigation all details are public no guessing needed so it seems miss Lerner wished to stay away from litigation in court so as to avoid having all details of these issues from becoming public these facts lead one to assume that this could be the same motive she used without with win-win withholding information from Congress we also know she lied or misled this community committee on numerous accounts we asked her whether the criteria for evaluating tax exempt applications had changed at any point miss Lerner responded the criteria had not changed but it had in 2012 she told this committee that the information the IRS was requesting in letters to conservative tax exempt applicants was not out of the ordinary but on May 13 2013 that also was refuted in fact a forty-year 48 year old veteran or the IRS said he never once had seen such applications go to the chief counsel's office we also know former IRS acting commissioner Steve Miller told us that the IRS was under and I quote Mendes pressure from Senator Carl Levin to implement new regulations and quote so considering all of this why would this committee cease its efforts to get to the truth why should it constitutional rights were infringed upon by the government and it is our job to get the American people answers so you see without miss learners full cooperation and without immunity either this committee nor the American public will have the answers it needs from its government now the Ways and Means Committee has voted to ask the Department of Justice to take miss Lerner to court for orchestrating the targeting of these political groups disclosing tax payer information which is a felony and obstructing these ongoing investigations so after going over these steps and the facts I would like to ask my colleagues across the aisle to tell me how it is that you can legitimately argue that we conclude that we can conclude this investigation is it because the president says so is it is it because the ranking member Cummings has said so how about Attorney General Eric Holder is it because there is a piece of evidence out there the totally absolves miss Lerner and all officials at the IRS from these wrongdoings yes so why hasn't the minority share these documents with the majority so that we may move on to other important oversight matters if this truly is a waste of time prove it to us and we can move on until then I recommend my friends across the aisle quit crying foul but when not if but when we get to the bottom of this I hope there will be no one on the other side of the Dyess who will be determined to have obstructed the pursuit of justice I would like to close by saying that I personally find no pleasure in today's proceedings I do not find pleasure in holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt I do not enjoy holding any federal official in contempt of pursuing criminal charges doing so means we have a government run amuck and such a situation is a lose-lose situation for all citizens regardless of political beliefs as uncomfortable as it may be it is our job to proceed actions have consequences I am simply a firm believer in the rule of law and the responsibility of Congress and specifically this Oversight Committee to ensure that the federal government operates in a manner that the public sees fit our government in this case the IRS and the Justice Department are in a sad state of affairs this should be a turning point to restore justice and accountability both in the person and in the government institutions institutions granted authority by the people to serve and protect people not abuse them I support the chairman in his pursuit of justice and accountable government and it will support the resolution holding this learner in contempt and with that I yield back

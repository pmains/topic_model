enormously grateful to uh to our representatives and senators for joining us for today's presentation as you know this blue pacific futures webinar series is a collaboration between georgetown university center for australia and new zealand and pacific studies and the center for pacific island studies at the university of hawaii at manoa we're very pleased to be joined today by senator brian schatz senator maisie hirono representative ed case and representative kai kahali in or we were under a bit of time pressure i i have to say i just had late notice that the senate has scheduled a vote on the ndaa shortly and uh and given the the busy schedule what i'd like to do would be to forgo an elaborate introduction to each one of our speakers uh you saw their bios on the reservation page for today's event and what i'd like to do would be to to pitch to each one of the uh the speakers and ask them to maybe just take a couple of minutes to talk a little bit about uh the way they see the pacific islands uh in in uh from the frame of hawaii and then i'll open up with a series of questions to our to our four panelists and a word of warning uh my screen is acting up a little bit if for some reason suddenly i stop moving or stop or i don't hear you um i just would ask just to go to the next speaker thank you so much and so senator schatz could we toss to you first and just uh just briefly talk a little bit about uh hawaii's interest in the pacific islands thanks well uh first of all thank you for doing this and thanks to all of the attendees and it really is great to get the whole hawaii congressional delegation uh on this zoom for this purpose it kind of shows our uh collective commitment you know not just to uh hawaii as uh you know the headquarters of the pacific command and all of that but uh for all of us as policymakers we understand that our predecessor our uh uh my predecessor in particular daniel k inouye understood his job to be someone who represented uh island nations throughout the pacific region that didn't have representation in congress and so i'm pleased to be here on that basis let me give you five areas where i think the united states needs to do better first we need to treat island nations as nations in the context especially of the climate crisis not as downstream from the impacts and decisions that are made in places like glasgow and paris and bonn at all of these cop meetings but rather full partners in the geopolitical sense that's number one number two is that's all great and it's really critical but they need help on the ground there are runways that are being inundated there are fresh water sources for drinking and for irrigation that are now being uh increasingly saline saline and we need to help them fix what is happening in terms of climate change we also have to work as hard as we can on vaccine diplomacy and the deployment of the vaccine as broadly and as deeply as we can it's not enough to just touch every country with a few vaccines we have to make this a real effort and as you see the data in particular pacific island nations it does correlate with with with economic outcomes and so we need to be aware that there are some nations they're doing really well and some nations that need a big push and a lot of help fourth we need to tackle iu fishing this is an area where we can really collaborate with for instance australia new zealand the philippines south korea japan and others especially as we think about you know so-called competition with china it's not just a military buildup it's also understanding that the assets of the pacific are collective assets they are commons and they should be protected on that basis and finally we need a long-term pacific development uh finance strategy we need to work with australia new zealand japan with the dfc with usaid with coast guard with the state department to make sure that we can deploy private and public sector resources for economic development so thank you for the opportunity great thank you senator uh senator hirono well just listening to brian uh he pretty much covered all of the areas i'm sorry i was going to yeah what can i leave now i'm going to go get a cup of coffee well clearly our delegation works really well together because we as an island state we are very aware of the importance of the pacific island nations and i think as a delegation we pay due respect to the importance of our alliances throughout the asia pacific area and as a member of the armed services committee of course i am especially focused on some of the initiatives that we have that will build our alliances with the pacific island nations and the fact that we can do and should be doing a lot more in terms of for example vaccination distribution that brian talked about but we also have other initiatives that involve military exercises the biggest being rimpac which involves over two dozen countries from the asia pacific area and so all of the alliances that we have in this part of the world is part of what i consider the asymmetric advantage that we have over china because china is our biggest competitor and china has been very busy in our part of the world with with their build and road initiative as they seek to really expand their influence not just in our part of the world but in africa and other places and they are in there with a whole of government approach to island nations they're building hotels they're about building up reefs and all of that and so china is very intent on expanding their influence in our part of the world and so it makes it even more important that initiatives such as the pacific defense initiative that we know that would really focus our assets and uh resources to the asia pacific area um when we have something like pdi it is really important that we don't just say well that's a nice thing to recognize the importance of this part of the world but we actually have to put resources here and in that regard it became pretty clear that the department of defense had not put enough of the kind of attention and resources that we would like and so there was a mismatch and i have joined with senator sullivan and the ndaa to have language that requires the dod to make sure that we are actually aligning resources with the importance of this part of the world and island nations said that where so much of their economy is dependent on fishing it is really important that our country works with them uh to help them with the the illegal unreported uh unregulated fishing and so uh the kind of programs that we have to train them to interdict uh not just illegal fishing but human trafficking and drug trafficking the kind of partnering that we can do in training we can do through the coast guard for example is it is the kind of practical kinds of things that we can do and and i want to close by talking about the importance of the compact that we have with the with micronesia palau and marshall islands and these compacts are very important to our national security but i don't think that as a nation we provide enough resources and enough in terms of the kind of partnering we can do to help them with their infrastructure needs etc to acknowledge how important these compacts are and we are in the process of renegotiating these compacts very important to our national defense uh and so this is the the kind of area that i point out to the military of brass starting from that department of the secretary of the dod and making sure that we we are acknowledging and providing resources to our island nation friends in the asia pacific area so we all sit on different committees you probably know that alan and and part of the reason for that is that we all were very much in in the committees that we are on uh pay attention to what's going on in our part of the world and of course to represent hawaii strongly and i want to mention of course thank you georgetown university and the university of hawaii and all the students from um that are on this program but i happen to be i think i'm the only graduate of both these schools so there yes so mahalano for all of the research and the good works that both of these programs do thank you great thank you senator mr case i feel like i've got to know you very very well through this little tiny box of zoom but uh it's great to see you again and uh i know that you've been a leader in in putting together the pacific island caucus in the house and i'd love to hear your your introductory comments uh thank you so much alan and thank you for all of your uh involvement in the pacific islands for so long i mean all of us have relied on you in one way or another and i'm i'm really happy to be part of this and i and i think um as brian i think said the fact that all four of us are on this call all attest to our interest in in the pacific islands um i do uh i do you know of course uh this is all extremely topical on many many different levels uh from from you know china to climate changes as senator schatz mentioned and maisie speaking to many of our um efforts in in the defense uh part of it and we've seen firsthand our our pacific island leaders stepping forward again on the world stage in the last couple of months at the united nations and at kappa 26 especially on the issue of climate change where they have been the world leaders for for decades now uh this is an existential threat for them and it's it's a gratifying and one way to finally have them be a little bit more listened to along these lines uh um but of course we have to take action at this point i guess i would also note at the outset that um you know in in the civic we are all one ohana our family uh for those that are not familiar with that word and i think it's comparable to new zealand um um and anytime there is um you know uh dislocation and unrest anywhere in the pacific it's it's a concern to all of us i certainly uh wish the solomon islands the the very best in working out uh what is happening there right now that is uh that's a that's concerned for everybody and we wish them very well um i i appreciate your mentioning our pacific islands caucus because uh really one of my observations coming back to congress was that at a time when the importance of the pacific generally in the pacific islands in particular so when i'm talking here about the pacific islands i'm not talking so much about the rim countries uh australia new zealand japan um you know et cetera but uh i'm talking about the actual pacific island jurisdictions of 25 or so jurisdictions uh independent countries uh territories uh uh departments of some countries freely associated but all real really with a common uh culture um and and a common way of of going about life and common challenges from climate change to to geographic isolationism to to um you know difficulties in in developing a broad range of economic uh activities and thus exposures particular exposure to pandemics such as uh uh that of course we know have been tremendously damaging to many of our pacific island uh uh countries and jurisdictions um and that was one of the reasons why we did form the pacific islands caucus a few years back in congress where uh i and other members who felt strongly that we needed a better centralized focus out of out of the u.s house of representatives on the pacific islands got together on a bipartisan basis and formed our pacific islands caucus which now has a couple dozen members to it uh including the leaders of many of the committees of jurisdiction and subcommittees of jurisdiction uh tremendously well received by the pacific islands themselves so we've worked with you and other scholars we've worked with pretty much all of the embassies on on actually turning our our focus into legislation of which the primary vehicle is the blue pacific act which uh basically stands for boosting long-term u.s engagement in the pacific it's designed uh really to direct uh uh to to magnify and accelerate and diversify um our own foreign aid uh and assistance uh to the countries and islands of the pacific it's not uh focused uh on the on the defense side there's a whole bunch of other stuff going on there uh maisie spoke to the pacific deterrence initiative that's invaluable from that perspective but the blue pacific act aims at uh humanitarian at security assistance to illegal phishing which both of the senators spoke to are really on a coordinated basis this has been lacking in our in our in our public policy uh for for a while now uh and um that blue pacific act is moving along just fine in the house it's now part of the broader eagle act it also has uh elements from bills that uh the two u.s senators here i have worked on and have sent over to us from from the senate and we're really hoping that once the senate figures out the ndaa will turn back to that we have to figure it out yeah private inside joke but um that we will also turn back um to to um the the engagements of the pacific that we are aiming at at uh whether they be the blue pacific act or or others i guess i would mention just really briefly um in in my time uh remaining um back to your i think your original question was where does hawaii fit into all of this um obviously in hawaii we fit into this in in innumerable ways um and of course you know indo pacom being located in hawaii and and the strategic location of hawaii has a lot to do with it but anybody that thinks that that's kind of the end of it um is making a huge mistake and i think uh most of us understand that in the pacific we of course come from a common culture and whether we're ethnically pacific or not we are still of that culture we still think that way we are still able to uh i guess what i would say uh provide cultural translation between the pacific islands and and our country and perhaps other countries and the ways that we navigate uh washington dc we certainly have some of the leading institutions in the world on the pacific in hawaii whether it be the east west center or the asia pacific center for security studies or the university of hawaii itself or other institutions where world-class uh work is being done on the pacific islands and and where many many many of the leaders of the pacific islands have been educated and still are educated and so um you know it's it's more than just a a saying that uh in hawaii we we really are in many ways our countries at least a center of the pacific and that's a role that we welcome and relish but we we need to turn that into action back to you great thank you mr kahali we wonder if we could get your your views on uh hawaii's place uh in the pacific islands hey alan thanks so much and and uh it's great to be here with all of you and mahalo iloa for inviting me to this uh you know georgetown university of hawaii blue pacific futures uh discussion you know i get to go last junior member of the delegation um and uh you know many of my my colleagues have already touched on a lot of really important things for the pacific but i'm excited to be here in the congress to represent hawaii i'm proud that hawaii has sent a native hawaiian back to the united states congress you know following the big uh hard to fill sometimes shoes of senator akaka but i am proud that the state of hawaii and the east west center host this pacific islands conference and that this year a number of critical regional priorities are being discussed things are really important to the delegation climate change and the impacts on our pacific island nations covet 19 and helping those nations get through the pandemic recovery connecting the digital connectivity between the pacific and infrastructure development marine resources development and conservation especially as it has to do with uh papahanau moko aka northwest hawaiian islands um some of our fisheries in the western pacific and uh the 2050 strategy for the blue pacific continent that i know our pacific leaders are developing pacific leaders uh alan have contributed uh greatly to u.s national security and prosperity and um our exclusive access to military testing ranges in our kofa countries are critical for the national defense of our country um pacific islanders uh like myself who serve in the via national guard serve in the u.s military at a disparately higher rate but historically this population uh has often been overlooked and and treated unfairly in in many cases as we wind down 20 years of uh war in the middle east and counterterrorism operations and we pivot to the pacific and given the current security environment and increased attention to china you know this region is finally getting the attention it deserves senator hirono and myself both serve on our respective armed services committee uh and and that allows me to be a strong supporter of the pacific deterrence initiative uh which uh is planned to invest almost five billion dollars into vital military capabilities in the pacific to deter china in the pacific region in the fy 22 defense appropriations bill everything from the takmar over the horizon radar and palau to the um homeland defense radars in hawaii and guam um there's a lot of really important things that that need to be done in the pacific for us to be able to position ourselves um to stay ahead of that pacing threat which is which is china um on the uh other side uh i'm a proud member of the pacific islands caucus which congressman case talked about uh in the u.s house i'm a co-sponsor of the blue pacific act boosting long-term u.s engagement in pacific and this bill like he mentioned will significantly expand u.s engagement in the pacific islands region and uh provide almost a billion dollars in u.s assistance for the pacific islands region over the next um five fiscal years just a few weeks ago we had a chance to meet with president palau and his delegation you know we are um and have conveyed to the administration how important it is that we uh come to the table and negotiate in good faith and come to an agreement before you see these agreements expire um with with our fas and our and our kofi states and that's it's really really important uh for us to do that um and and we had a chance to meet with uh the uh president palau and and and his delegation and everything from um security issues in the region illegal fishing human and narcotics trafficking unlicensed mineral exploitation and pollution these are all things that are really really important that um you know we need to talk about and and i'm hoping this administration does that you know we've encouraged this administration to appoint as quickly as possible and assistant secretary for insular affairs in the department of interior that is still unfilled uh so that person can be the belly button for doi in the pacific we've also advocated for a special uh envoy uh designee to lead these negotiations um uh that are really really important to palau and and our smaller pacific island nations but again mahalo allen for for having myself and the rest of the delegation here um and uh thanks so much and i really appreciate it aloha thank you very much uh your comments are very much appreciated i i wonder if i could um several of you have mentioned the the kofa states and uh negotiations on uh the the next negotiations for for the for the compact states and i know that the relationship between uh hawaii as as a destination for many citizens of fsm marshall islands and palau that there's a there's a strong relationship there i was wondering if i could get you to talk a little bit about um uh hawaii and the the as a destination for uh kofa citizens and maybe talk a little bit more deeply about about some of the challenges that kapofa states faced um it seems to me that that you know the vaccine diplomacy has has worked very nicely but there are still some some serious challenges and you know we have the problem of of the pacific regionalism and pacific regionalism seems to have been dented uh by the last round of elections for the um uh the secretary general of the pacific island forum so i was just wondering if i could just sort of tease out from from you a little bit a few other comments about uh the us relationship with the kulfa states what the u.s could do to rein encourage the the the renewal of pacific regionalism and address some of those challenges that uh that are exist in the funding of the the uh the compacts and that's anyone ever the two of us who are members of the our respective armed services committee are very uh aware of the importance of the compacts but the challenge is that i i don't think that too many others of our colleagues understand the importance of these island nations to us and these compacts are so important that they their citizens can come to any state without the need for a visa and this is why especially during the pandemic it became very clear that you know that hawaii and guam host more compact citizens than any other places there are some in guam and there are some i'm sorry arkansas i believe and some other areas but this is not a population that is necessarily acknowledged but during the pandemic it was clear a lot of them were in the front lines working in meat packing uh plants and and all of that and that is why i am very uh aware of the need for advocacy on our part to to let everyone know that as we negotiate these compacts that we provide more resources to these island nations because of course they have education issues they have economic issues they have health care issues and one of them as far as i'm currently one of the major things that we did to help the compact citizens was to enable them to qualify for medicaid this is a qualification that was taken away from them during the the the clinton as part of the clinton so-called welfare reform and it took us literally 10 years to restore that eligibility to them and and and so we also have a bill to enable them to access some of the other social and network program social underpinning programs that they should have but it's a it's a pretty uh challenging road to whole wouldn't you say my colleagues yeah let me just add a couple of things you know obviously the the sort of top line is we have to um renegotiate the compact of free association that's obvious um let me make a couple of observations you know it's not just bases and i think the challenge is that the department of defense understandably thinks in terms of you know being forward and having access and being operational in the region that's a reasonable aspect of our relationship but we do need to think of of our relationship as a relationship with sovereigns right not wards of the state not folks who need assistance but other countries other nations other cultures other sovereigns and i think the reason that i think it's so important that we talk in those terms is that i've never seen so much racism in hawaii as i have [Music] uh with our fsm brothers and sisters and that is something that i think all of us collectively have a responsibility to fight against uh uh it's it's it's just historically true that whoever is the most recent immigrant group usually gets picked on but that doesn't make it any more right and that's something that i think we have a collective obligation to fight against especially given hawaii's uh you know not a perfect history but a better history of integrating various cultures into our melting pot all right i think i think i would um i i i want to amplify everything that my colleagues just said i mean um the focusing just on the kofa countries just for for for for now um of course though the challenges that the sick islands face are are are economic uh healthcare education um and it is completely natural for for folks to to want to seek a better life and a better place and of course those countries challenges is to try and our challenge is to try to help them to provide that life uh in the countries of origin for those that want to stay there um um the compacts have been um incredible agreements uh for our country and for their countries all around um places like hawaii have been asked to bear a disproportionate burden for that and we're talking about in the hundreds of millions of dollars a year of uncompensated uh federally required services and that's why maisy's efforts on medicaid were incredibly valuable and it's unfinished business um and what brian says is exactly right um there there's a tremendous cultural dislocation that comes uh from from from you know leaving your island homes in the pacific and moving to honolulu or wellington or or auckland or anywhere else for that matter and we know that we now have larger populations of pacific islanders from some countries in our countries than are in the countries of origin to start with um the other side of it is it's really exciting uh to see the the development of these communities um in hawaii and elsewhere and into real generations of of involvement and influence and advancement of across the board i know that each of us has had that experience i've i've had interns from from the pacific islands in my office i've nominated them to our service academies they're going to be leaders of our military at the upper ranks i'm i'm positive of that and so we've got to keep that going so i think you know from our perspective we are all focused on on on on moving those contacts along as fast as possible what congressman ellie spoke to is exactly right we don't frankly think this administration is giving them sufficient focus yet and sufficient um um advancement on a quick enough basis and that's what they want and that's what we think they should want and we want it too so that's part of all of our effort i want to talk just briefly to your comment on pacific regionalism because i think this is really a real challenge for the pacific right now the sitcoms forum has served very very well from that perspective uh to to bring the pacific island jurisdictions and countries together to try to think of of of of the pacific in in a collective sense as opposed to individual and to work together collectively on climate change or economic development or any other number of things and you know obviously um some of our um competitors particularly china i would love uh that regionalism to fail um if they can't dominate it they'd rather divide and conquer um and i think and i think that we have to be very practical and very realistic about that so that so that the current challenge to the forum is of great concern to me and i i i very much hope that they work it out now it's their forum it's not our forum and you know uh we don't want to dictate um uh what they should or shouldn't do but i certainly hope and believe and and uh encourage uh that that be worked out because the failure of the forum i think would be a big setback for for the pacific yeah alan i'll just chime in you know i mean i look at it real simply right the kofa states are ours to lose the united states to lose and um you know that would be devastating to to um to our country on a number of fronts you know the pacific island region is is very dynamic it changes every day china is on that doorstep every day and uh in many times it's changing not necessarily in the united states favor you look at micronesia who's withdrawn from the pacific islands forum and uh you know statements made by this administration uh where the secretary of state in testifying that these negotiations are a priority those are his own works but there have been no meaningful negotiations or conversations that have happened at least publicly um that i know about since then you know when you look at the like what senator schatz talked about you know i live on hawaii island out in ocean view going towards my you know ancestral home of milolii is a large um community uh they're an ocean view of micronesians and um and and different pacific island um um communities there and and there's a generational trauma that these communities have have had to endure um because of nuclear testing and things that we've done a long time ago so when you look at roonette dome and the united states responsibility to make sure that radioactive material is housed safely that's something that we got to address and so it's about relationships um it's about uh that marriage and nurturing that and and having um you know um you know the right opportunity and and negotiating um opportunities with these countries and what we don't want to do is have these um agreements expire or or take um how they it took over seven years for these agreements in the case of palau um and then then you get into a fight of who's paying for it and you get congress got to come in and pay for it and then it's discretionary dollars versus mandatory dollars and what kind of message are we sending when it's funded via discretionary dollars so that's just my thoughts that it's ours to lose thank you so much um i'm just curious then we had a we had a question from greg brown at uh georgetown university and you know and and many have have mused over over the past few years about the united states or others uh extending compacts or pre-association with uh curabist for instance and i'm i'm assuming that given the comments that i've appeared here today uh that wouldn't be very high on your priority would that be safe to say or is there room to to countenance expanding the the compacts of free association to other pacific island countries um well i guess i've never thought about it uh and so it's it's it's a worthy thought i mean uh we want to strengthen our engagement in relationships in in the pacific uh the compacts are are one of our relationships and engagements that happens to have a a historic uh basis to it in the old trust territory of the pacific islands which did not uh correct me if i'm wrong academic scholars did not include kyrie boss um and so and so i guess i i don't react against it on a no basis i guess maybe what i react again i react to it on is um on the basis of we need to get these compacts done and right again for for 10 years now kyrie boss is of course as we all know a major issue right now uh because um first of all it's the closest to us in hawaii and and uh on on a number of ways and and yet it it it certainly um has has had more engagement with china and china vice versa um than than many of the other pacific islands so it's something we ought to be concerned about and we ought to be focused on on on on on engagement with kiribati in particular come in on the back of that this this kind of raises for me and several of you have mentioned uh china quite pointedly and i'm just curious are there downsides uh for um really having a china-centric approach to the pacific islands in american foreign policy i mean today you know if if i were to to ask someone from overseas can you describe u.s foreign policy towards the pacific islands i think what i would get would be there's there's concern about china and the driving force is china but is there a downside to that yes um absolutely um and it's sort of maddening look i understand that um that we need access to bases and installations and we want partners in in the military and geopolitical sense but uh a pacific strategy has to do with the pacific and not solely uh with with our only near peer adversary that's uh a factor but it can't be the only one because i think what happens then is that the dod drives all of the strategy and it becomes a matter of war preparation rather than using all of the tools in our toolkit in terms of diplomacy and soft power and economic and cultural influence and our greatest strength in addition to the world's greatest military is that people like us and they do not enjoy getting bullied and so just the fact that tony blinken is doing um you know by zoom uh these these bilats just the fact that these nations are being treated like nations again is central to our strategy because the way america leads is by being the indispensable nation um and that is not just a matter of well if it ever got kinetic we would win because the truth is if it ever got kinetic sure we would win but everybody would lose and so the point here is to create peace and prosperity in the region and the way to do that is economic partnerships disaster prep climate adaptation investment vaccine diplomacy uh managing our natural resources together um that's the way um that we dominate this specific century but we do so in a way where it's not just purely martial and and who's got more carriers and carrier groups and and and better you know radars and bombs we will always win that battle but that's a heck of a way to prepare for the pacific century and i think it's really important that this not get driven exclusively by the dod and by defense contractors who benefit from more and more equipment sorry all right senator china has a a whole of government approach and it's not just their military assets which we're not going to in terms of sheer numbers they have more planes more ships more assets military assets so clearly we're not going to compete that way china has a whole of government approach which includes economic and and soft power all of that and that's the kind of long-term approach that we need to take china is definitely a near peer competitor not just in the military arena but in the the economic area and right we shouldn't i agree with you brian that we shouldn't uh look at china as the enemy as such but it just goes to show that we have to really re-focus on the alliances that we have throughout this part of the region and that includes japan that that's new zealand that's australia that's south korea india and our alliances are where our power i think lies and that's why i refer to our alliances as our asymmetric advantage in this part of the the world as well as basically in throughout the world and i i must say that during the trump years uh our our allies really wondered where the heck we were and now you know we have uh they're still wondering uh what what is going to be our fate but uh um i very much support a whole of government approach to our dealings with china it's uh thanks alan you know um you know i agree with both senator schatz and and hirono's uh um comments uh beyond the economic piece another way to look at this as well is how the united states can step up in terms of economic partnerships and investments and one of the most important things is education you know we know that education is uh um you know very very important when you know developing an economy and developing communities and and and strong families and the united states through the universities that we have can partner with many of these pacific island nations uh to further their educational advancement you know and for example penn state university uses uh technology to extract water uh from the air and um you know when we're talking climate adaptation and salt tolerant crops and wind solar wave power production you know traditionally pacific islands have always had ways to be climate resilient and and have climate adaptation and mitigation um things that they do so i think there's a important role for the educational component throughout the pacific other nations where universities can play an important role in the innovation uh that can help this you know particular region of the yeah i mean you know the fact is that you can't talk about the pacific islands without talking about china and you can't only talk about china and you can't only talk about everything but china it really has to be all of the above and and um so without a without a co as as maisy was saying it coordinated policy that reaches across all aspects of our government we're not going to get this right and i think we are getting it right by the way uh so i'm not i'm not i'm not fearful of it but you know put yourself in the situation in the pacific islands i mean you don't want us to be interested in you just because of some geopolitical um you know uh competition between the us and china but you're also caught in a very realistic uh challenge of of of of basic how do you provide for your nation how do you provide for your infrastructure how do you provide for education and health care in a whole range and so you know the lesson there is china is perfectly willing and able and capable of providing all of the above it's just that they're not providing it out of of a selfless motivation they have their goals and and and so if if we're not stepping up to that plate uh on on on on across the board um we leave these nations with very few choices um and they don't want to be in that situation and we don't want them to be in that situation so we have to talk realistically about china but if that's all we're talking about that's that's a huge mistake as senator schatz said thank you very much um as as everyone uh would acknowledge the the pacific islands have been in the very much in the news in the past few days uh with the uh the uprise of uh some some violence in honey era in the solomon islands and there have been you know accusations floating around that the united states and taiwan have somehow uh acted to to in fact incentivize uh through through uh financial contributions to malaysia the the region the province in um in the solomon islands uh that's created some some discord uh there amongst the local population and so rather than get stuck into the solomon islands how can we ensure that with the blue pacific act or with uh senator schatz's honor the honoring oceania act how can we ensure that we are planning our spending and conducting our spending in a way that is mindful of quite frankly some of the fragility that one finds in the pacific islands small conflict-sensitive climate-sensitive uh regions that that you know are facing numerous uh economic challenges so i was wondering if anyone would like to talk a little bit about how we ensure that we spend our money wisely and uh not just in an accounting sense back to the united states in terms of accountability but how do we spend it wisely uh in the pacific islands i'll i'll take a swing of that um and and i i apologize if i'm gonna stay at the kind of 30 000 foot level but i will just observe that um at least on the foreign relations committee in the senate people members have incredible granular understanding of eastern and western europe and all of africa and uh central asia and the middle east and when it comes to the pacific if you talk about go you know doing a codel a congressional trip to the middle east people can't even picture in their minds eye how far away certain places are from other places right like you know i i led a codel to uh to to the philippines japan and korea and someone said well can we add in india i said well you know not without a few extra days right and and it's just an observation that otherwise really knowledgeable people who understand uh leaders leaders in exile the status of the legislative body the status of press freedom um economic indicators um think of the pacific as the thing in between conus and china and so i think it starts with at the oversight level for us to demand that level of expertise and sensitivity and then i think that flows into the state department's work and all the agencies that the state department either works with or funds yes i'd agree that the awareness of the this part of our part of the world is very very much not exactly there and this is why i would say that our work is really important to continue to call attention to this part of the world but it's also not not just the island nations but it's all the surrounding countries that we need to engage with and during the trump years the state department was howled out and and so we didn't have the kind of presence and all of the the island nations not to mention our major allies such as japan and the other nations so i i really part of it is that we have to continue to call attention and that's where your programs matter and that's where the east west center matter i would say that these programs need to attain a higher profile and we can probably you know look to you folks for more help because i i would venture to say that there aren't that many people who know that georgetown university of hawaii even has these kinds of programs that very much focus on uh what's going on in the asia pacific area so you know there's a lot of attention building that we need to engage in and clearly ed's caucus uh is another critical area and if you can get some of this legislation passed sure but in order to in my view you know to give this legislation passed but other people have got to figure out oh this is important we should pay attention we should enact uh these pieces of legislation this is why in my view something as critical as simply allowing compact citizens to get to get medicaid coverage took so darn long shouldn't have been like that but we shall plug away i know i know we are and i think with uh our continuing banking on the state department and the dod uh with maybe um a higher profile for for uh programs like yours it will help yeah you know thank you oh sorry please go ahead okay i'm saying i i i think you know sometimes we can over complicate this i mean um first of all uh you know as you as you asked how can we get give you know get to the pacific island nations the the aid that they need well first of all we ask them number one and and then you know sometimes in our history uh we have uh decided what others need whether they needed it or not uh rather than ask them and then and then help them with that and i think um you know i think we're doing we're on the right track into the pacific islands but we can always listen and uh better uh number one and number two it's it's not rocket science what is needed it's it's basic infrastructure it's economic uh development it's and sustainment it is it is the basic social infrastructure of education and healthcare um uh you know areas and needs that uh perhaps we tend to take for granted here a little bit sometimes uh and and so you know these and these as you know are are with one or two exceptions uh small countries with very small populations and so it doesn't um you know it it you can make a huge impact in a very quick uh period and and and you know the legislation that we have that we're all working on on the pacific islands right now is is essentially in so many words uh trying to do the same thing on the non-defense side um of our aid as uh the civic deterrence initiative uh is trying to do on the defense side where we're trying to we're trying to say to our defense uh you know effort um hey you have to focus on the pacific and you have to have you know sources of funding that can be relied upon over time um that are gonna go to the civic not you know get siphoned off somewhere else in the in the in the establishment and so you know it is it is um i don't think the needs are complicated uh but the but this but the focus takes a while and the and the dedication over time takes sustained effort thank you very much i'm just reminded of the comment uh of uh robert underwood i didn't know if you remember bob but you know he was the president of uh the university of guam and the former delegate uh from guam in congress and he came to georgetown and uh gave the peter tully coleman speech and it was a wonderful speech and i said to him at the end i said tell me a little bit about the reception of of your colleagues about the pacific islands was there interest in congress and it was the only time i saw bob frown and he said he was really disappointed in that that other members simply didn't weren't curious and i i i found that tremendously stagnant and i hope that that all of you uh can help encourage uh that kind of curiosity and then wanting to know uh amongst your colleagues um uh the uh professor kabulaka from the university of hawaii uh my colleague in putting together these events has just made the observation that uh the u.s through ussp scholarship offers three scholarships per year to students in the south pacific china offers hundreds of scholarships is there any opportunity to increase scholarships and i think this goes to the broader question about people-to-people connections between the peoples of the pacific and uh and and the mainland us and also deepening the understanding uh the intellectual understandings between peoples of the pacific and uh uh people here in the uh the 50 states and i was wondering if anyone would like to comment on that well i i'd say that these kinds of educational exchanges are really critical and there was a time you probably know and i don't know the exact name of the initiative but it was to enable hundreds of students from china to come to our country to study and there was an actual focus program i went to a reception to that and all that's out the window now because anytime you mention china you have people like tom cotton and others just jumping up and down trying to make sure that we have no engagements at any level with china which is a mistake so i'm sure that your programs you know have identified different things that we can do to to shore up these kinds of engagements but at the at the moment i am not particularly aware we have sister state relationships i think there's some exchanges that can occur but i i am uh open to ideas that you all have and by the way i just was looking at the the screenshot that look at our delegation we have the most diverse delegation in the entire congress wouldn't you say because i mean i i am an immigrant i'm a japanese you have a jewish person senator you have a caucasian person there and then you have a native hawaii my gosh isn't that incredible i've never been referred to that way um izzy the caucasian person asian person you're the white i guy that with the affection you know they can take it in that spirit let me just add one thing you know the east-west center is a gem and a couple of good pieces of news about the east west center susie varus lum was just appointed as the new president she's going to be extraordinary um for the first time uh the east-west center was well for the first time in a long time was not zeroed out in the president's budget uh and um so it doesn't have to be fought fought for in the appropriations process we can try to plus them up but we don't have to fight back from zero and uh finally they really are focusing on climate action climate adaptation with a particular focus on the pacific islands so while other programs have shrunk i think the east-west center you know continues to do extraordinary work and everybody knows heads of state throughout the asia pacific region are our alumni of various programs and and um opportunities at the east west center well and i i'm i'm so happy you mentioned the new president of the east west center she's fantastic so yeah and in my conversation with her i said yes we all agree that the israel center is a gem but not very many people know uh what what really they do and the kind of influence that they can have throughout this part of the world and i just want to mention that all of us have various bills that will that will really focus on the spread of the world but i actually have a bill that that senator menendez uh is leading and it's called the insular area climate change act to provide u.s territories and the freely associated states financial and technical support for climate change planning mitigation adaptation and resilience efforts so here's a guy from new jersey who's taking an interest which is a progress that's that's that's tremendous that's tremendous that's great outreach um perhaps uh uh we're coming up just the last couple of minutes because i know that there is a vote scheduled in the senate at six o'clock and i really appreciate um you hanging around as as you have that vote looming but um i just this is an opportunity perhaps just for some some concluding uh remarks um i'd love to hear from from the the panel uh about whether you see there's an opportunity for the united states to deepen and expand its diplomatic uh connection to the pacific islands you know we rely so heavily on countries like australia and new zealand uh for engagement in melanesia and in parts of polynesia is that something we should continue to do or should we should we develop our own relationships love to hear your comments in short yes okay now i'm actually going to answer this slightly differently i don't know the answer to that i think it's pretty a pretty consequential thing and i'm not sure whether we should have our own it sounds good to have our own direct lines of communication but relationships are tricky and and trying to establish your own new line of communication may subvert the existing relationship kind of ecosystem and so i just don't know yeah i i think the answer is yes myself um i think that if if you um go out in the pacific islands and and talk to talk to them them they will say to you that that the way we've approached the pacific islands where where uh the united states has prime has has more has has focused more on micronesia for for all kinds of reasons obviously than than perhaps some of the other pacific rim countries in australia on uh you know melanesia and new zealand on on polynesia even though hawaii and new zealand are both polynesia um has had both benefits and downsides the benefits obviously have been you know focus and coordination and um um you know maximization perhaps of of assistance the downside is that some some of the of the parts of the pacific would would would like to continue that relationship but would also like the other countries to participate as well in other words that um you know the united states for example should show up more in papua new guinea or the solomon islands for that matter um and you know we had a very interesting thing that just happened in in palau which of course is is part of micronesia where where um australian uh military were embedded in a in a in a marine corps exercise by our country um in flow and that made huge news in palau that that australians uh were there as well as as well as united and i so i think there's i think there's room for improvement i i think and and speaking directly to the united states um the diplomatic side did suffer over the last uh years where we were you know pulling out the peace corps and closing you know consulates and and uh doing other stuff and what message does that send if you if you if you if you you know the peace corps one of the most invaluable things we've done for generations from from a u.s outreach to the rest of the world uh gets pulled out of a country in the pacific islands uh what are they to make of that um and you know consulates uh just basic consular presence and function uh that that's also invaluable to many of these countries especially handling the traveling back and forth and so um these are small steps that we can take to regain our our um you know the the the the refrain that you some sometimes hear from many parts of the pacific which is all you really have to do is show up a little bit more and and and and and help us out uh with with the things that we need help with but you got to show up first and so i think that's fair criticism for for us and and it's it's something that we should fix and can fix i totally agree with uh my colleague uh congressman case you know the united states needs to show consistent presence you know in the region in these areas you know one of the things that we do not to you know keep talking on the military side of the house but through our national guard we have many states throughout the country including hawaii that have vital critical state partnerships with many of these countries wisconsin has a state partnership with papua new guinea and the adjutant general of wisconsin works together with his mirror image in papua new guinea and they just don't do military exercises they do humanitarian and disaster relief exercises they provide economic uh support education uh and those those relationship building opportunities hawaii is indonesia and the philippines but you know throughout the entire pacific you have valuable relationships and state partnership programs with defense attaches in these smaller island nations and uh you know that's that's something that i think we do uh we do the best we can we could use more funding for it um but uh it is what it is but you know i do agree that we need to show a consistent presence and um there's a lot more that we can do well i i want to thank the four of you for for joining us uh mr kahele mr case mr schatz and uh mrs hirono i thank you so much for your time uh what a wonderful presentation and it was great to see some graduates of georgetown university and the university of hawaii at manoa it's great thank you all so much all the best

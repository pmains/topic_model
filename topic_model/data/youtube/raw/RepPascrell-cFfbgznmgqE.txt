is brought to you by your cable or satellite provider Washington journal continues joining us representative bill Pascrell Democrat of New Jersey a member of the Ways and Means Committee good morning to you hey John good to see you on the topic of taxes sir Kevin Hassett is the White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman he says this about the past tax cuts from Republicans saying as of April 8th nearly 500 American employers of announced bonuses or pay increases affecting him more than 5.5 million American workers as a result of the passage goes on to talk about Walmart's impact says eventually that for someone working 40 hours a week there may be getting up to $3,000 a year in additional pay he sees benefits of what was passed how would you react to that I would say those figures are very interesting but the two last reports that I've seen on the impact and it's early we understand that of the tax cuts that were passed by the Republican Party and signed by the president is that it's a far cry from what they professed $4,000 per filer that isn't going to happen it doesn't look like second we know that most of those dollars 83% went to higher income folks in the United States of America and interestingly most of that money went to either those folks who hold shares in these companies this is not a middle-class tax cut like any stretch of the imagination another trickle-down deal which I do not accept whatsoever since I believe in trying to help those who need to help most when it comes to then what you're seeing in your state is there any indication of how New Jerseyans a reality guys we got slaughtered in this legislation when they did away with the local and state tax deduction over $10,000 the average property owner in New Jersey's paying taxes about 18 to 20 thousand dollars in that range and so that deduction by the way after that deduction goes back before the code in the 20s the tax code it goes back to the Civil War and if you look at the origin of why this deduction was so important and now it's helped so many people is that we were concerned during the Civil War that most of the money would go to the federal government to be used in the war to protect America and it's and its values and then there'd be no money left for local roads hospitals whatever the case might be it was a good move this to me was probably the worst part of the tax cuts that were asked you can access your you can ask questions of our guest by calling 202 seven four eighty eight thousand one for Republicans 202 some parade eight thousand for Democrats and independents 202 some parade eight thousand to the administration is billed as paying for these tax cuts depending on growth in the United States predicting three percent growth over many quarters do you do you see that kind of math absolutely not I believe that this was a setup to get into what they really want to do and that is cut Medicare and Social Security we've already seen those cuts in Medicaid which is very very important not just to the poor we have very little idea of what Medicaid really pays for and who gets the benefits when they're needed so I would say that's that it's not going to pay for itself and if you just saw the latest report we're talking about 2.3 trillion dollars added to the debt and we are Democrats we are the ones that tax and spend I think we got it a little bit backwards one of the issues and even as of yesterday you made this still an issue was what about Donald Trump's tax returns and what you'd like to see happen I'm glad you put that up and page old its tax days been extended of course for another day I think that the country has the right people haven't known I have to know if there any potential conflicts and since Donald Trump the President of the United States we only have one president at a time his money has been invested in over 50 countries 500 properties we don't know anything about it but we're not talking about a 1040 form that we want to look into we're talking about thousands of pages that go with your business doings and your dealings and the debt that you have incurred over these years to find out Willie where the president stands on these issues and there's been numerous reports on how since he raised the sand and became the president that there are potential conflicts whether it's his property his hotels his golf courses and so I think we have a right to know that why in twenty and twenty fourteen when the Republicans looked in if you remember Lois Lerner she was a head of the IRS and they used 1603 D which was part of the tax code which was a result of the big scandal in 23 1923 of teach not teapot don't remember tap on grammar school the nuns pushing that into my head and I've never forgot it and I read about it as much as I could in here again it pops up on as a member of Congress that was the reason why that part was put in to protect people's privacy but on the other hand there are three committees in the Senate in the house that can go into someone's taxes can't make the public unless it is voted upon by either the Ways and Means Committee as Senate Joint Committee on taxation and as detract the financial committee so we got three committees that have the right to look into it they'd if they use this 6103 to go into Lois Lerner's not not to attack Sakana but then they went into almost 50 other accounts to show that the IRS was trying to show the IRS was targeting conservative groups which of course nothing ever came out of it so it's good for goose it's good for the gander as well and we're gonna get those tax returns if we don't get it the Congress of the United States in using a checks and balance system which the forefathers were smart enough to put in there then maybe mr. Muller will get them we'll go to our first call for you it comes from Illinois Republican line Bob you are on with our guests Bob pass a bill Pasquale of New Jersey go ahead morning Bob how do you feel pros and cons about making the tax cut permanent for the people yes well what they're doing now because they got a tremendous pushback because it's permanent for corporations as you know Bob but it wasn't made permanent for the middle class and anybody else to do it now to me is playing catch-up politician we warned them what was going to happen this should have been across the board why are corporations any more important than individuals and by the way they've been enough Supreme Court decisions to show that maybe corporations should be treated as individuals also they're treated in terms of campaign financing anyway from Ohio independent line Ron good morning good morning morning congressman how are you sir I'm Mike that's fine thank you my question is the lower the corporate tax rate from thirty five percent to twenty one percent I didn't vote for that well I'm glad well how much better would it have been to lower it from 35 to 25 or even twenty four and put the extra dollars into our deficit or another program that we do we want well that would be much more reasonable Charlie Rangel myself to ten years ago recommended when we were in the minority that we lower the corporate rate we Democrats were not against lowering the corporate rate that's a lot of baloney we recommended it be lowered from 25 from my 35 to 28 and I think 25 would have been a reasonable conclusion also what we've done is put ourselves deeper in debt and we haven't taken care of the middle class and that's what we need to do in a shrinking middle class in the United States of America thank you about Connecticut is where Lou is clean Connecticut on our independent line Lou your next stop oh hello good morning I live in a blue state and you're a guy from a blue state I answer no let's no I'm going to be leaving this blue state this year for a red state and the reason why is because of what the Democrats have done the opposition to Connecticut New York New Jersey you kill them you're killing those states and you know what the tax the tax the fact that the taxes are lower now are going to be big help uh at that's that's the biggest thing that I recommend in anybody and I quote I used to be a Democrat but I'm not any longer everyone needs to go to a state that's friendly the lower than blue states are unfriendly the detachment okay well I think it was tremendously unjust for blue states to be targeted when they put this tax package together which was not tax reform in any manner shape or form low these were tax cuts for those people in the top seventeen percent of the economy in the United States of America and to take away the deductions that the people in Connecticut New Jersey New York Illinois California used to kind of balance things at the end of the year I think was a very horrible thing to do these are not reasons why people buy homes but to have that deduction kept you in your house and I think it was a very sad thing to do so look you're talking about local politics in Connecticut in local politics and taxes in New Jersey which is a legitimate issue a legitimate issue but if the federal government shrinks its responsibilities and does not live up to those responsibilities in helping the state's new taxes are gonna go up even more if the house turns back to democratic hands in November is there any strategy as far as reversing the taxes or making changes to the tax code that was passed I think that it should be revisited there's no two ways about it but to do it now as I said before to catch up so realize you've made a big mistake they're not making your permanent because you even perceptually showing people that you cared more about those who have it against those who are trying to make it so I think it's a big mistake right now I don't think you'd get Democratic cooperation at all at this point you they did they're saying look they didn't even ask us how can anybody even question this we weren't even asked as members of the tax writing committee to be part of the process coming up with a tax split we had no hearings we had no witnesses if you remember the last time we did to actually form real reform which we had bipartisan support was in 1984 85 and 86 from our own state senator Bradley was one of those people congressman ken Kent New York they were forces forces that got people to understand we got to do this together and if one party chooses to do it all by itself it usually doesn't work out very well if that changeover does happen in November it's reported that you're pushing for Joe Crowley odd at the head of the Democratic great job and I think Joe would make an excellent speaker this is not a coup I nominated Nancy Pelosi last year I would do it over again but the point of the matter is we need to go in a new direction and I think it's healthy for the party and I think Nancy even believes that so whether she'll stay on if we take over the house I don't know but there's no coup intended by anybody well when you say new direct and then what do you think has to change within the current directing that the party's going well I think I think leader Pelosi did the right thing at the beginning of last year when she opened the leadership up to a lot of younger congressmen that have come in I think that's a healthy proposition I think it's been good for the party but I'm not we're not only talking about that Nancy Pelosi when we're talking about leadership changes we're talking about maybe we need to change in terms of the entire brigade of leaders that we have that doesn't mean they've done anything wrong look there's a poster child from in every election like Republican leaders are the poster child and there's nothing you and I are going to do about that from California Republican line bob is next hi hi how are you doing gentlemen listen ishutin good morning there's the initiatives never discussed on this and it's thrown out and then not addressed completely now I've been in the mortgage business I've retired from it for 35 years and in that period of time I have done lending I have done secondary market I have sold loans and bulk sale to the secondary market is mortgage security and the one thing that has always amazed me because we talked about the property tax issue is that states on the East Coast the property tax will typically outstrip the level of the house payment so in essence what the customer is doing is they have a house payment of eight hundred nine hundred dollars a month but between the local tax the property tax school tax etc their tax bills $1,100 now they're not getting anything for that $1,100 to speak out they're paying more in taxes than they are for a house payment that happened in California back in nineteen seventy seven and they rolled it back because of prop 13 you had people who could not afford their houses anymore not because of the payment but because of the constant increase in property tax so the state that taken away the property tax was a disservice you got to ask yourself a question how did the property tax get so high to begin with okay it's because underfunded pensions of the labor union okay caller thanks I would agree with your last statement states did not live up to their obligations to not only unions but supporting pensions even in the private sector I think that this is something we need to take a look at you brought up an interesting point but when we talk about high tax states we need to take a look at each state and why if you're living in a state that is highly dense population like the state of New Jersey and you have a state where you're going to have higher property values the properties that the people that make a higher income are usually living in those kinds of states right now not that doesn't mean exclusively but then you're going to see taxes because the services are needed you need a different kind of service I'm not justifying every tax hike what I am saying to you every state is different and unique and that sometimes property taxes are the main means for revenue for that particular thing so you got to go state-by-state that's what you need to do and by the way in 2007-2008 it wasn't simply because of the the state's taxes that brought down the foreclosures of homes it was the primary reason is that lenders and mortgage people took advantage of those individuals when we had those member of first time buyers and those folks were getting or saddle the debt they could never play if a debt is the basis of what you're talking about sir not only in terms of property taxes but in terms of our retail stores throughout the country why do you think point toys-r-us is closing because of Amazon or because of some other ridiculous reason no it's because they were saddled with too much debt and they couldn't get out of it that's why well hear from a viewer in New Jersey's neighbor New York and his next Democrat slime yes I would like to see the Democrats in Congress band together and refused to vote with Republicans on anything until Mitch McConnell agrees to bail bring a bill on the floor to protect Mullin and Rosenstein I think that mr. Miller needs to be protected he deserves it he's a great Patriot in America however I don't believe that we going to serve any long-term purpose by not agreeing on things that we can't agree on I mean we need to bring the country together and not separate us further we polarized it you know all of us and we need to bring us back together because it has an effect a deleterious effect on the population that's not healthy people start to look inward they don't see the community community is critical to solve all our problems just like it's good for Democrats Republicans that get together so if the Democrats take hold of the house in November your thoughts on if impeachment proceedings should start well I don't think we're there yet but I think it's something we're going to have to take a look at there are too many conflicts of interest here too many a finger in the eye to the checks and balance system and I think that this is very critical for us to stand up for in 2014 I referred to this before Pedro in 2014 when Republicans who took control of the house and the Ways and Means Committee went after people's individual tax returns they turn to the very basis in which I'm trying to get the president's tax returns I think they would be very revealing every presidents in Richard Nixon has done this we have a right to know if our sitting president is in potential conflict if when he brings the folks from the Middle East to his hotel in Washington not that he brings them physically but they use his hotel whether his profits there are really in coordination with the Constitution of the United States he was told this president to divest himself of what he had invested in he didn't do this the ethics commissioner at that time is the shop told him you need to divest this is why you wouldn't have any problems he shows us they on he's still making profits his family still making profits if that isn't an unusual situation I don't know it is we have less than 10 minutes in the segment Betty in High Point North Carolina Democrats lying you're on go ahead good morning gentlemen thank you for taking my call Republican path of representative Pascal you were asking the question earlier concerning how Medicaid families might be affected by what's going on I just had a caller last night I was speaking with my daughter I have expressed 16 year-old special needs child she has never she's a she's been diagnosed as being in the autism spectrum but she's never had a concrete diagnosis when her mother had did not reach out for any type of assistance until she was 5 years old she's never lived in public housing she her mother's always managed to find some way to provide for her family she was telling me last night that her Medicaid had been cut she's a single mom she's taken care of two daughters her older daughter is a school at the local community college she works 12 hours a day in a that was threw up for me she went to that job as a quality control person but when she realized the difference between her salary and the salary that the men were getting she went to management and she requested a position that the man held she's the first woman after many many years this is a very old company it's hard labor and I don't mean interrupt you or you're sick of time yeah we'll get that the represented respond yes just let me say this we get calls in my office about this all the time the last budget cut Medicaid by sixty four billion dollars that's on page 34 of the Republican budget I will never forget that cut because I had so many calls about we're talking SSI and we're talking about disabilities there is no question go back to the question I got a couple of phone calls ago don't we think that we can get into you know doing some things now that was not in the tax cuts to try to go back over it again this is a disastrous bill which is hurt a lot of people and yet most of the money from those tax cuts by the numbers go to those people who don't need it go to those shareholders who don't need it and this is not a cut for the general common good of the United States of America if you want to call my office I don't know what state you're looking in you call my office leave your name and number and I will call you back man let's go to Rex he's a Minnesota Democrats line good morning c-span pedra I'm a big fan of yours big fan of c-span and Bill I really might very much appreciate your frank candor this morning I think you're a straight shooter and I appreciate your service to the country thank you in the house I really do appreciate it now I'm somebody who is an quite an activist but I am somebody who likes to be able to formulate ideas for my local representatives for how they can go door-to-door in my community north of Minneapolis to say to people here is the reason why you need to vote Democratic and then point to this tech sham that was passed in December I don't want to get into Trump bashing I want to make sure the facts are set up straight and clear for everybody to understand and we are in a conservative district so how would you frame that argument so you pointed out in a very genteel yet concrete fashion yeah I think you're you're on target because you need to talk in a and a comment or have dialogue with those who don't agree with you but in order to do that you're wise to say you got to know the facts of the particular situation and then have that dialogue I've never excluded anybody from any dialogue I've ever had but it was a town meeting or whatever I think that that's important we shut out each other we say these people don't agree with me so the heck with them no that's no way to get a resolution the problem and if you do that you're not going to last long I don't believe you last long look we've had examples in New Jersey where some congressmen would not have any town meetings people went to their offices and sat in I don't recommend that but this is the result of that kind of a thing I think you're being wise and what you say and instead of thinking about it as a red district in a blue district think about it as an American district which brings you will bring the facts to whenever you have that opportunity you know we're not gonna go there to argue you're gonna go to have dialogue of another topic on trade real quick the front page of the Financial Times saying Beijing's open to letting some more automotive trade happen between do you think this is a result of the president's talk on China and at least when it comes to tariffs or potential tariffs well I think you know as the ranking Democrat on trade in the Congress you asked a loaded question not that you attended to be loaded but we're talking about negotiations right now on renegotiating NAFTA renegotiating the Colombian trade deal we just finished work on the South Korean trade deal and China the president yesterday administration yesterday refused to say anything about China concerning currency manipulation we've been on this Democrats and Republicans for 15 years would actually kidding so whether there are discussions going on behind the scene so that China you open up a little here we won't say anything negative about you there which would simply be part of the president style you know he thinks he's doing a business deal every time he talks to you this is not business this is government and we can't run our government because we have a checks and balance system because these are folks that are democratic democratically been elected like to do a bus of business we're out stay in business last call will be Kelly Qi from Maryland we've got just about a minute so go ahead and make it fast please it's real quick I just want to say that I'm really the point about the promises response relating about the Democrats getting together to protect New York simular in it and it's demonstrative of water reasons why people don't start Democrats to me then when they have the power to actually mixing things they're looking for a compromise and the person they're compromising with Republicans is not looking for compromise okay okay sorry about that we'll have to leave it there government is the art of compromise so I'm sorry to tell you that but that's what America is all about does it mean that you surrender your values does it mean you surrender your ideals it simply means we got to come together and have a resolution of a problem but also we solve nothing I will not be an obstructionist to Republicans if we can come together on agreement on regardless of whether talking about education transportation or foreign policy and I think that that's the way to go and I've been successful with that up until now our guest is representative bill Pascrell Democrat from New Jersey serves on the Ways and Means Committee thanks for your time this morning I'm honored and that's it for our program today the House of Representatives just coming in for its business on this short week we will take you to them

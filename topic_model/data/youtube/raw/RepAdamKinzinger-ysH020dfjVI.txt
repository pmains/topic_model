  OUT IN HEARINGS TO COME. >> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL PAT CIPOLLONE TESTIFIED TO THE JANUARY 6th  COMMITTEE ON FRIDAY. WE'RE JOINED BY CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO  "THIS WEEK" THIS MORNING. WE JUST HEARD CONGRESSWOMAN  LOFGREN THERE. ANYTHING MORE YOU CAN SAY ABOUT  THAT? IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THE  COMMITTEE DIDN'T ASK MR.  CIPOLLONE TO CORROBORATE  THE SPECIFIC OF CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON'S TESTIMONY? >> IT WAS AN EIGHT-HOUR  INTERVIEW. WE WENT THROUGH A LOT OF STUFF. AS ZOE SAID, HE DIDN'T  CONTRADICT ANYBODY. WE'RE GETTING THEIR INFORMATION, THEIR FRONT, THEIR POSITION, I  THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR YOU'LL SEE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HEARINGS A LITTLE OF WHAT HE SAID,  CERTAINLY YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF THAT IN THE REPORT, BUT AT NO POINT NO CONTRADICTION OF  WHAT ANYBODY SAID. THE REST I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE TO  THE PRESENTATION FROM THE  COMMITTEE.  >> TRUMP ADVISER STEVE BANNON  HAS BEEN INDICTED FOR REFUSING  TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. BUT REPORTS THAT TRUMP IS NOW CONSIDERING WAVING  ANY CLAIMS OF EXECUTIVE  PRIVILEGE TO BANNON. DOES THE COMMITTEE STILL WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM? >> I'LL SAY OVERALL, STEVE  BANNON IS INVOLVED IN THE LAW,  HE'S FIGHTING WITH THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT, I'LL JUST SAY ON A  HIGH-LEVEL POSITION, ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO COME IN, WHO KNOWS  INFORMATION, TO TALK WITH THE  SELECT COMMITTEE, WE WELCOME TO  DO SO, UNDER OATH, WE'LL SEE HOW THAT COMES OUT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, YES, WE AS A COMMITTEE WANT TO TALK TO  ANYBODY WHO HAS INFORMATION. >> DOES THAT HOLD FOR THE OATH  KEEPERS' STEWARD RHODES. WHO OFFERED TO WAVE HIS FIFTH  AMENDMENT TO TESTIFY PUBLICLY. >> AGAIN, ANY ONE OF THESE  THINGS WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT AS  LONG AS IT'S UNDER OATH. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING FOR  SURE BY COMMENTS LIKE THAT AND  ANYBODY ELSE'S, THEY WENT FROM  INITIALLY SAYING THAT THIS  COMMITTEE WAS NOTHING BUT A  SIDESHOW, TO SOMETHING NOBODY  WAS INTERESTED IN, TO ALL OF A  SUDDEN, OH, YEAH, I WANT TO  TESTIFY PUBLICLY. WE SAW THAT FORMER PRESIDENT  TRUMP IS VERY ANGRY THAT KEVIN  McCARTHY DID EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP  WANTED TO DO WAS PULL OUT HIS  REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,  BECAUSE NOW HE HAS TWO  REPUBLICAN MEMBERS WHO AREN'T  GOING TO SIT THERE AND SPEW OUT  THE BIG LIE, SO THIS IS AN  AMAZING THING FOR THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE TO HEAR THE TRUTH. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE WANT THE TRUTH TO COME OUT SO THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS NEVER  HAPPENS AGAIN IN THIS COUNTRY. >> IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE  BREAKING THROUGH REPUBLICANS. A LOT OF RECENT POLLING SHOWING THE  NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS OVER THE  LAST YEAR WHO VIEW THIS AS A  LEGITIMATE PROTEST ON JANUARY  6th AND NOT AN INSURRECTION HAS  ACTUALLY DRAMATICALLY RISEN, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT? >> WELL, LOOK, ON THE MARGINS  IT'S PUNCTURING THROUGH. WHAT WILL HASTE HISTORY SAY IN  FIVE YEARS? I CAN GUARANTEE YOU -- WELL, IN  ABOUT TEN YEARS, A SINGLE TRUMP  SUPPORTER THAT EXISTS ANYWHERE  IN THE COUNTRY, IT'S LIKE NIXON, LOT OF PEOPLE SPOTTED NIXON  UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF OFFICE,  THEN, LOOK, NOBODY SUPPORTED  NIXON. THE OTHER THING IS, WE LIVE IN A MEDIA ENVIRONMENT, WHERE YOU GET YOUR MEDIA FROM WHOEVER ENFORCES WHAT YOU ALREADY BELIEVE AND  THERE'S A PROFIT MOTIVE ON SOME  OF THESE MEDIA OUTLETS TO NOT  SAY ANYTHING CONTRADICTORY TO  WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING,  HE IS IN ESSENCE A CULT LEADER  RIGHT NOW, A MAN WHO CAN STAND  UP AND SAY ANYTHING HE WANTS AND THESE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS JUST  REINFORCE, IF YOU HAVE LEADERS  OF CONGRESS LIKE KEVIN McCARTHY, LIKE MOST MEMBERS OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY IN CONGRESS,  THAT JUST SIMPLY REFUSE TO TELL  THE TRUTH TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS, FIRST OFF THEY'RE LYING AND  ABUSING THEIR CONSTITUENTS. SECONDLY, CAN'T EXPECT THERE TO  BE MUCH OF A DIFFERENT OUTCOME.  >> KEVIN McCARTHY'S ALLIES ARE  PROMISING TO REVIEW THE  COMMITTEE IF REPUBLICANS TAKE  CONTROL. YOU'RE RETIRING. DOES THAT CONCERN YOU? >> NO, NOT AT ALL. IN FACT, I WELCOME THEM TO SEE  THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE,  BECAUSE, AGAIN, AS WAS  ORIGINALLY STATED, WE WERE  SUPPOSED TO HAVE THIS  A COMMISSION, EVEN 50%  DEMOCRATS, 50% REPUBLICAN, KEVIN McCARTHY AFTER SUPPORTING IT  OPPOSED IT, COMMITTEE WAS  CREATED. THE SPEAKER SAID TWO  PARTICIPATED IN THE  INSURRECTION, YOU CAN'T HAVE  THAT. PULLED THEM. KEVIN COULD HAVE PUT TWO  DIFFERENT MEMBERS ON. THIS HAS BEEN A BIPARTISAN  COMMITTEE AND I'M VERY PROUD OF  THE WORK WE'VE DONE. I'LL BE WELCOMING ANY SCRUTINY. >> WE'LL BE LEADING THURSDAY'S  PRIMETIME HEARING, WHAT'S THE  FOCUS AND WILL WE BE LEARNING  NEW INFORMATION? >> WELL, OBVIOUSLY, WE'LL SAVE  THAT NEW INFORMATION FOR THAT  HEARING. WE'LL FOCUS ON WHAT WAS THE  PRESIDENT DOING FROM IN ESSENCE  THE MOMENT THE INSURRECTION  STARTED UNTIL HE FINALLY, HOURS  LATER, PUT OUT THE WITH TWEET,  WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS. KEEP IN MIND IN THE MIDDLE OF  THAT, TWEET, THIS IS WHAT  HAPPENS WHEN YOU STEAL AN  ELECTION, THAT VICE PRESIDENT  PENCE DESERVED THIS. WE WANT TO SHOW THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE IS, WHAT WAS THE  PRESIDENT DOING THAT TIME. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY KNEW  THERE WAS AN INSURRECTION. THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY HAD TO  KNOW THERE WAS AN INSURRECTION. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. PAY ATTENTION. BECAUSE I THINK IT GOES TO THE  HEART OF WHAT IS THE OATH OF THE LEADER. YOU CAN'T BE GLEEFUL DURING IT. >> FINALLY, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED THIS WEEK THAT BOTH  FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY  AND HIS DEPUTY ANDREW McCABE  RECEIVED THESE SUPPOSEDLY RANDOM AUDITS. OF COURSE THEY WERE BOTH  OFFICIALS WHO WERE TARGETED  PUBLICLY BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES IN YOUR  VIEW THAT THOSE AUDITS ARE AN  INNOCENT COINCIDENCE? >> LOOK IF YOU JUST TAKE THOSE  MATH NUMBERS IT SEEMS VERY  UNLIKELY. I DON'T KNOW OF COURSE THE  DETAILS OF THEIR FINANCES AND  WHAT COULD POSSIBLY TRIGGER IT. NOBODY EVER FOR THEIR POLITICAL  VIEWS, FOR ANYTHING, SHOULD BE  TARGETED OR DISCRIMINATED  AGAINST BY THE IRS AND I  CERTAINLY THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR  THE INVESTIGATOR TO LOOK INTO  THIS IN THE IRS, AND IF THERE  WAS TARGETING THERE SHOULD BE  SERIOUS, SERIOUS NOT JUST  PENALTIES FOR THE PERSON WHO DID IT BUT, YOU KNOW, FIXES FOR THE  SYSTEM SO NOTHING LIKE THIS  HAPPENS AGAIN. THAT'S THIRD WORLD STUFF. NOT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. >> CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU ALWAYS FOR YOUR TIME. >> YOU BET. >>> ROUNDTABLE IS COMING U

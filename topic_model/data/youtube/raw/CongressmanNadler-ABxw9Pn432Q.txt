mr. speaker this resolution is the legislative equivalent of fiddling while Rome is burning our president takes to the world stage to side with a hostile foreign power over his own intelligence services here at home he engages in government-sponsored child abuse in the form of family separation policy that continues to terrorize children as young as six months this non-binding resolution before us would do nothing to bring about a fair and just immigration system in fact it would do nothing at all it is just a meaningless political stunt to change the subject from the international and domestic shame unleashed on us by President Trump the president imposed the family separation policy and his administration never even considered how to ensure that the children would eventually reunite with their families now nearly 3,000 children remain separated and they do not know when or even if they will ever see their parents again many of these children were ripped from the arms of their mothers and fathers and their anguish is unimaginable but this bill would do nothing to reverse this disastrous and cruel family separation policy it would do nothing to ensure that parents and children are accurately tracked so that families can be reunited and it would do nothing to address the horrendous conditions separated children are being subjected to for example 14 month-old baby mmm we must use a pseudonym was separated from his mother for 85 days at 14 months and he returned so full of dirt and lice that it appeared he had not been bathed the entire time he was in federal custody his mother Olivia says he is not the same since they were reunited and he cries whenever he does not see her out of fear that he might be left alone again mr. speaker this is a humanitarian crisis we do not have the time to waste with political stunts like this bill well the moral fiber of our country is torn apart I will be voting present on this bill because I have no desire to play the Republicans in moral games right now we have much more important things to do I reserve the balance of my time

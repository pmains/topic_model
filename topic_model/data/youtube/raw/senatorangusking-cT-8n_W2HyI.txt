now snoring isn't one of them their event the answer is right under your nose this is CNN the most trusted name in news [Music] the White House is reviewing that controversial memo written by Republicans that alleges surveillance abuses by the FBI Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee voting to make that memo public however they are blocking the Democratic rebuttal from being made public joining us now to help us try to understand this is independent senator angus King of Maine he serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee senator thanks so much for being here with your absolutely so the house Intel committee won't even show it to the Senate that's my understanding the chairman or a Republican asked to see it and it wasn't forthcoming why won't your house colleagues share whatever is so important in this memo that they release it to the American public why won't they share it with the Senate you're asking the wrong guy you can seed to ask them I I don't really understand it there's a great contrast in this situation between the famous torture memo that wasn't a memo it was a report that was done by the Senate Intelligence Committee five years ago we're number one it was first given the the the the the lengthy document 6,000 pages 500 page summary thousands of footnotes was given to the CIA in advance so they could respond to it because the information was so sensing classified that they needed to sign off and we wanted to get their point of view on the conclusion so we had me I had I remember having meetings with individual CIA with groups of people from the CIA saying we disagree with this conclusion and here's a fact that's off so we that went through about a six-month period okay and the fact that the house Intel committee is not doing that and not showing it to the FBI though the FBI has asked and not showing it to the DOJ though they've asked what does that tell you well it's it's it's just it's not a responsible process I mean and let me finish the story about the other after we voted to release the report it went to the the the White House where's another six months to redact it to be sure we weren't compromising national security here's the problem you can have something that loot may look innocent to you and I in a report that's based on intelligence data and our adversaries can reverse-engineer that data and figure out how we got it and that's why the the intelligence agencies are so upset about this that's by the FBI this would be reckless to release it because it could tip off people it could it could expose sources people who might be embedded somewhere in another country so now it's up to the president he has five days to decide whether to release it do you think that he should I don't well based on what I know I mean I haven't seen it right I don't know what's in it I don't know the background of it but my sense is that this should be very very carefully gone through in terms of how it might compromise national security that doesn't mean it ultimately shouldn't be released the other thing that bothers me is that apparently well number one this is a Republican staff report it's not the entire committee secondly my understanding is there's a Democratic staff report clearly that should be released it they're voting not to I I don't understand it well I mean doesn't this just say what we were talking about in our last segment that B's Intel committees you tell me you're on one have they devolved into total partisanship to the point where they're almost not effective ours hasn't I can say that categorically the Senate committee is working on a bipartisan basis doesn't mean we're always going to be able to maintain that and there aren't going to be differences there haven't been differences but I feel and I think the other members feel and Republican and Democratic members feel it's important to maintain the integrity of the process so the ultimate product is understandable and acceptable with the American people I will quickly ask you about the ultimate product because one of your colleagues on Senate until you're vice chair in fact Mark Warner says that you have all received quote extraordinarily important new documents in the investigation do you know what he's talking about I do but I'm gonna let him do the talking but do you think that can you say can you back this up enough to say that there are new documents the Senate Intel committee has received they have changed the course I wouldn't go that far any investigation always ends up going in in directions you don't expect when you find new information and this is something that we're gonna have to follow up but that's I really don't feel comfortable talking about where we're going or what we're finding let's talk about the sanctions Congress passed legislation it believed that Russia should be sanctioned to the I guess strongest order and the President signed it they locked in late last summer and that hasn't decided not to implement right it's it's it's very disturbing we I've been to I don't know 20 30 hearings at armed services and intelligence over the past three or four years about cyber attacks on our country including what happened during the 2016 election and one of the biggest things that's come through is that right now we're a cheap date in the sense that there are no consequences there are no results for when you you do something to us we don't do anything back and this is an example there's an old joke as I won't tell the whole long joke but you know a guy burns down your house kills your family shoots your dog and you chase him for 10 years and at the end you find him and you say you got to cut that stuff out you know I mean there have to be if if the Russians aren't paying a price for what they're doing they're gonna keep doing it and by the way they're doing it right now you're ready for this yeah there's a Russian troll farm there's a group in the United States that tracks what they do and and you know what their leading hashtag is this week out of the Russian troll farm what release the memo oh yes yes yes we have heard that and so when the State Department says well it's already working you know we don't need additional sanctions it's already working they've gotten the message all they've got to do is go to Hamilton 68 and see that they're trolling us right today senator angus King thank you very much always great to have you pleasure nice to see you Chris all right big question here can lawmakers on both sides of the aisle strike a deal on immigration specifically to help the dreamers before the shutdown deadline next week we will ask a Republican congressman at the center of negotiations next

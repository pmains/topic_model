things change over the weekend and we should talk about the tragic events of this past weekend for a moment and they call us to pause and reflect on the promise of our democracy and our responsibilities as its beneficiaries and stewards as we entered this beautiful building today many of us pass by these concise Magnificent words the First Amendment Charles had carved in marble in the newseum Pennsylvania Avenue facade it's the only 74 feet high Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances my parents used to say that everything we needed a democracy is in there it promises diversity practice any religion you want or none if you want to be able to speak and be protected by your government in your speech that guarantees diversity you guarantee diversity you guarantee a democracy and the day before she was bailed in the attack in Tucson congresswoman Giffords was a member of the house of representatives who roll it was to recite these words on the House floor in a free society the society that we Americans must always want our country to be government should not it must not restrain free expression but we learned as children with freedom comes responsibility the full flowering of democracy and freedom relies on the south restraint of each citizen organization and group of citizens the printed page the radio microphone the televised image the TV ad the blog posts in the Twitter feed all have the power to an i er to motivate and to inform but they also have the power to enflame and incite the seething rhetoric has gone too far the demonizing of opponents of government a public service has gone too far our politics have become incendiary and we all share the responsibility for lowering the temperature that is responsibility we all have to keep our democracy strong and thriving the 535 members of the House and Senate have been elected to represent more than 300 million Americans from all walks of life we have responsibilities within our borders but we also have responsibilities outside our borders as our nation charts its way in a very complex and often very very dangerous world it is time to stop the polarizing symbolism and instead work together on the substance of the many challenges we face as a nation otherwise our country a blessed bountiful an expansive nation that survived a revolutionary war a civil war two world wars and everything in between faces decline I cannot accept that and neither should anybody in this room you know the Dean mentioned I'm the only Democrat elected to the Senate Vermont's history suddenly I was introduced that way once a day shortly after I was elected in Vermont and a voice in back rooms as a England make that mistake twice but we you will recall the story of the landslide of Franklin Roosevelt when he carried every state except Maine and Vermont well shortly after that this before I was born a born month player Franklin Roosevelt came to Vermont my father told me the story across the street from us was the national life insurance company the de facto headquarters of the none of the Republican Party but the anti Roosevelt very strongly aunty of Roosevelt wig President Roosevelt went by in an open car my father was standing next to the president of the national life at that time everybody men wore hats the president went by the the head of the company took his hat off held over his heart my father turned to him and said Jim I never thought so you take your hat off to Franklin Roosevelt he said I didn't I took my hat off to the president you know think about that we should show the kind of respect the things that do the Pima County Sheriff was an everyman of this tragic moment when he movingly called for soul-searching by all of us we need to work together for the good of the country and the American people after Oklahoma City after the horrendous attacks of 911 we came together and so now do we need again we need to come together the tragedy should someone else to meet the challenges we face not with emphasis on the issues that divide us but on common ground that can unite us it is easy it is easy to appeal to resentment and distrust and selfishness and hate leaders should appeal instead to our better angels and when common ground remains elusive we must respect the rights of others to hold and express their own views and beliefs and one more thing we must not allow any assault even this horrendous one on represented democracy to succeed in thwarting or muting our people's access to their elected representatives

joining us now Florida congresswoman congresswoman great to see you what was your reaction to the president calling Republicans quote fiscally demented well that's really rich coming from a guy who takes his orders from the Easter Bunny and can't complete a coherent sentence uh but regardless we're the ones that are going to get our fiscal house in order because it's clear that he has no interest in being serious about it the fact that this man in the white house has spent 10 trillion dollars over his first two years in office and wants to balk at us wanting to negotiate about reducing the size and scope of government give me a break we're the ones that are serious about getting the economy back on track because I don't know if anybody's noticed recently but the price of eggs is what people are going to be getting at the grocery store for a long time to come upwards of twelve dollars a dozen and I know that they haven't shopped for themselves recently but people like me and everyday Americans we're sick and tired of the inflation we're entire we're sick and tired of the welfare state we want to get our house back in order and Republicans are going to do it so it you know every Democrat since JFK uh even through the Democrat platform through George W through Obama was about cutting spending cutting taxes economic growth it's it's more I think it's more like 5 trillion since he took office 10 trillion since before the pandemic so you know Congressman Byron Donalds is saying we spent 400 million dollars for borders protection in countries in the Middle East and we're not doing enough for our border well that's exactly it I mean our priorities are all over the place and they're completely misaligned with what the American people want and need when you look just at the numbers and of course this is cyclical we go through Seasons but if you go back to 1980 for example I was born in 1988 as a point of reference but you looked at 1982 now our GDP on average when adjusted for inflation was about 5.3 now compare that to our debt since 1980 it's averaging nine percent a year I know I'm a Blonde but even I know that those numbers don't add up we're spending more than we're taking in we cannot continue down this path we've got to get our fiscal house in order so we need to end the emergency declarations we need to stop all the coveted spending we need to address the regulatory environment the silent killer of the American dream that processed two trillion dollars a year when you have 1.3 million regulations on the books somebody's paying for it and it's you and me and everyone else in everyday America and we've got to address the mandatory spending now people are panicking because they think that that means Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid got it there's 20 worth of fraud in our mandatory spending limit that's true that's a lot of fraud there you know let's listen to the president on how he and the Democrats really do want tens of thousands of new IRS agents and workers watch this you know all these new IRS agents we have is because they fired a lot of them and a lot of retiring and guess what who needs serious agents to know what they're doing or not doing the billionaires the multi-multi-millionaires how can somebody sense the Knicks who's been there since the Nixon era not know that the upper classes can afford tax lawyers to fight back against the IRS and the lower and middle class cannot afford those tax lawyers the CBO Congressional research service a joint committee on taxation already said that what they are doing is going to hit the middle and lower class hard with audits so what's with the consistent gas lighting here it's just a losing message that they're they're trying to promote it's just like how they said that the inflation reduction act would actually reduce inflation but even Bernie Sanders said it would expand it they don't know what they're doing and that's exactly why Republicans are back in charge of the house why we will take the Senate and the house the White House back in 24 we've got to get this guy who creepily Whispers these nonsensical answers out of the White House and I couldn't have said it better myself was it doesn't make sense congresswoman kamek we'll have you back on again soon it's good to see you thanks Liz

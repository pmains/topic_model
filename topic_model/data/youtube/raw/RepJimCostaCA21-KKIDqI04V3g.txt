hello I'm congressman Jim Costa today I want to speak about the pilgrims which occurred 30 years ago this week against the people of Armenian descent in some gate Azerbaijan in late February of 1988 the Armenian people of nagorno-karabakh commonly known - its people and they're just as descendants as are sunk joined together in a peaceful protest to demand their right of self-determination this valiant call for equality and human dignity was met with government-ordered violence against the Armenian people beginning in February 27 1988 this bloody attempt at suppression lasted for three days countless Armenians were killed and hundreds were wounded and thousands were forced to leave their homes and the livelihoods behind a clear violation of Human Rights yet this violence and hatred did not succeed in suppressing the Armenian people their determination has always been steadfast their dedication to to ensure that the Armenian people continue to survive from generation to generation is a hallmark and their refusal to sacrifice their freedom inspired by their democratic movements across the Soviet Union and to protect practice their Christianity is clearly something that we reflect on in such a positive way even 30 years later the zoom gate pilgrims still remind us of the sacrifice of the Armenian people have made in the name of freedom and self-determination unfortunately these sacrifices are still being made authoritarian leaders in Azerbaijan otherwise known to the Armenians as Artsakh continue today in 2018 to D legitimize the efforts by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group to achieve a lasting peace in Artsakh and the surrounding region we have yet to cheat achieve success to the thousands of Armenian Americans living in the San Joaquin Valley and to the Armenian people living throughout the world I stand with you I stand with you and remembering the lives lost during these atrocious pogroms thirty years ago this week and I want you to know that I stand with you and demanding the recognition of the Armenian Genocide the first genocide sadly in the 20th century I stand with you in the current struggles for a peaceful self-determination in our thought we must continue to advocate for the protection of human rights and democratic freedoms for the Armenian people and for all people throughout the world thank you

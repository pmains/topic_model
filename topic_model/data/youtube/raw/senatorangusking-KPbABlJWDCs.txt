holy i'd like to touch on your question the supply chain number one we've learned with in the covid situation how critical the supply chain is and how what a mistake it is to rely on supplies for critical materials outside of our borders the second piece is we have to realize that the chinese are integrating economic policy with intelligence and and national policy by subsidizing things like huawei to make it cheaper in order to insinuate itself into the nation's or the world's internet infrastructure we have to realize the cheapest may not be always the answer and maybe a little premium on the price to have control of the supply chain is an insurance policy and i think that's the way we have to look at this because historically we've just said well we'll get the cheapest wherever we can and that's going to bite us and supply chain i think we just have to analyze every piece of military equipment every piece of critical infrastructure and say where is it coming from and is it safe because i think you've identified one of the most serious issues that is facing us and it's not going to quit yeah thank you thank you for that senator king and thank you for your leadership uh over many years on this issue it's a privilege to get to serve with you on the committees that we do thank

chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York Thank You mr. speaker our national forests are among our greatest natural resources unfortunately these forests are under constant threat from invasive species and disease you do not have to search far to find a forest battling invasive pests disease or invasive vegetation the healthy forest Restoration Act was created as a way to help respond to these persistent threats my amendment before the house would simply add invasive vegetation to the healthy forest Restoration Act for the purposes of the designated treatment areas invasive vegetation chokes out our native by competing for moisture sunlight nutrients and space species like kudzu climb our trees and infrastructure and threaten the health and safety of the areas where it uncontrollably spreads when native trees are threatened it is not just the ecosystem that is damaged local economies sportsmen and those that use our land for other forms of recreation all suffer from degraded forest land adding this designation increases the effectiveness of healthy forest Restoration Act by taking a more encompassing view of the threats facing our forest land I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and reserve my time reserve

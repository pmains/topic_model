[Music] well good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight four months almost a year actually the refrain has sounded Russia hacked the election Russia colluded with Donald Trump it was unprecedented behavior treasonous really for that night after night on this show we've been told we need a massive semi-permanent investigation to expose all these crimes we might even need to nullify a presidential election okay so let's say that Russia did hack the election what would that look like a few thousand dollars spent on lame ineffective Facebook ads probably not instead it might look a lot like what was actually going on for years at the Podesta group the democratic lobbying firm co-founded by Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta according to a source we spoke to who worked there at the Podesta group for years the company received huge sums of money from a pro-russia shell group in order to bolster Russia's interests in Washington all without declaring itself the agent of a foreign power which it demonstrably was election hack he might also look like the infamous and fraudulent Trump dossier which was compiled in 2016 and then released this past January by BuzzFeed as a laughably stupid news story much of the information in that dossier came from Russian sources with ties to the Kremlin who paid for this well at one point funding came from the Democratic National Committee Hillary Clinton's campaign possibly even the FBI so let's say you were looking for a smoking gun in this Russia story and many are looking for that smoking gun we now have evidence that Democrats are literally paid money for Russian intelligence as well as proof that the top a democratic lobbying firm in Washington was getting rich by advancing Russian interests collusion if that's not collusion what is collusion we put a lot of calls out today and very few Democratic lawmakers were interested in talking about this at all the rare exception was Brad Sherman of California the Honorable exception and he joins us tonight Connolly thanks all for coming out thank you right here to talk about the tax bill well unfortunately mean this is a job-killing deficit exploding tax bill which is the real story the real vote in Congress uh-huh before you go we don't have a tax bill we have no idea what the details are we have the proposed 12 page literally nothing we have a 12 page diner which is pretty long it'll get to the Senate and it will become something completely different so I would love to debate that because I think it's really interesting and we may not even disagree on parts of it but I want to ask you about the story that we use defend the truck tax proposal this is a this is clever and I will have you on any day to talk about an actual tackle you won't again and again and you only have me on to talk about nonsense fear me then really the nonsense that the Democratic Party has hijacked the the workings of Washington for the last year over this Trump story with Russia's a number you just Laurie is you've got to so defense on Trump's impeachment the man has committed high crimes and misdemeanors and your only defense is well Hillary did too you can't improve it citizen and say that's a reason not to impeach a president who's guilty oh yeah I think you've jumped off the rails a little bit let me ask you some factual questions and see how you do with those you can put the bumper stickers away what what do you make of the fact that the Podesta group with whom I know you're personally familiar was taking money from Russian interest to advance those interests in Washington I'd like to take a look at it but it's irrelevant to whether we should impeach Donald Trump he is guilty of obstruction of justice but you're trying what do you make of the fact that the Democratic National Committee from who I assume you take money gave money to the the people who wrote the trunk dossier whose information came from Kremlin connected sources does that bother you that the first and foremost by Trump's Republican opponents is that in that dogs we don't know correct there is nothing in that dossier that appears to be stolen information what we have is from it well firstly you don't know that and I don't know but we know for a fact because it's been conceded that that information some of it came from sources around Vitus is a document that had no effect until whether we whether we impeach the character of a private citizen is an irrelevance II whether we impeach a structure of justice we but I'm talking hold on slow down okay the presidential election well you don't know if it hadn't affected the election how can you affect an election by a document that's released three months after the allowing information in of the the document was run in BuzzFeed the information went to the Hillary Clinton and what what and information was absolutely no use life of Donald trauma were not released I'm a little bit surprised that you have spent the last year telling us that Trump has colluded in some way with the Russian government and that he has committed in effect treason which is basically why I don't accuse him of trees and I cruise him of obstruction of justice take a look at well of the felony because we're not bothered by these committed obstruction of justice three times it's not the crime it's the cover-up right we learned that with Watergate and we learned could not have stayed in office serve Nixon Richard Nixon could not say you are a really simple question about the news of today which is the reason today is this tax bill that's gonna cost us millions of jobs don't know that's what happened a tax we do have the Trump tax proposal that you can't defend but is the official and most significant economic document released by the Trump administration I think I'm searching back in my metal files to recall an example of greater disingenuous nough sand the one I'm witnessing now you went bananas over the Donald Trump jr. meeting oh this is you know the end of times I never said that it just got me confused with another good-looking bald guy no I know you are the guy who did that we now get the tape it was it's the obstruction justice and I've identified why it was so poisonous to American democracy for Trump or his campaign to have any contact with the Russians you've got me confused with some other I'm looking bald I follow this for a living but let me ask my follow this for a living through time I know that this is the most significant economic document released by the Trump administration you can't defend it and you want to talk about nonsense sorry let me talk about why it is bad instead of white Donald Trump Shenfield articles of impeachment action of justice day after that story about Trump's unbroke that's the battle is that you oh that was just an accident okay right this is look I had I circulated those articles of impeachment a month before the date you identify yes let me ask you let me ask you really sit with July 2 let me ask you a simple question Trump's connections to Russia you have consistently argued are a big deal it's not a fake story or oh I have consistently argued that is obstruction of justice last February May and July are violations of section 1512 of our felony code obstruction of justice applies not that there was collusion or thing to do so your entire party has spent the last year telling us this is the most important thing that has ever happened we now have evidence if the charges you are making against Trump apply to your own party and your own candidate my in your July obstruction of justice three times violation of section you're not even you know what I honestly it's hard for me to believe given everything you've said in the last year that you're putting on this performance now why don't you just say look what Hillary did her campaign paying for intelligence from the Russians that was bad but she's not president let's move on you won't even say that I don't know what Hillary did exceptionally we do what do you mean we don't know we know exactly what she did they admitted it this week that they paid for opposition research every campaign of course their opposition it comes from the wari Everest dossier came from the world this dossier came from a research firm and a British individual individual do you know I believe his mid name as mr. steel yeah and why was he hired because he was the of the Russia desk at mi6 he was a Russian and the information was about Trump's ties to Russia they got this information from the Russians and they paid in effect Russian source they paid a man to prepare email does it bother you what does that bother you at all not particularly it's no bother you as the Podesta group ever lobbied you for anything I believe they have I believe they've also I believe you're also a friend of Tony not a friends with him and he's never lobbied me I'm not a city well yes but not a friend of Tony Podesta's but does it bother you that Tony Podesta took money with Paul Manafort from the Russians to carry their water in washes it bother you that Paul Manafort was chair of trumps camp yes it does well does it bother you that the Podesta firm was working on behalf of the Russians I would like to if it was true it would be it is true I mean there's you're asserting it a lot of things I'm not asserting it Oh factually you were saying that if you failed to file a foreign agents report you know that that's I believe that to be true what I know is true is that they took money from Russian interests to represent those interests here in Washington well you say Russian interests if you mean private companies that's different I mean karateka I mean the Russian government I mean the Russian government did it why don't you want to talk about impeaching a president and your answer is hey there's this lobbyist because etiquette for this impeachment is it only a page and a half and you haven't bothered to read it actually I have read them then you know and I think they're even more fat she was now than I did before now that I know that there's no principle that undergirds them that you're willing to excuse anything the Democrats Justice is a crime it is a felony we're not able by 20 years off that 20 years come back when you got a tax bill and you want to chat about it the tax bills been released and you can't defend it Yeah right biron new york chief political correspondent at the Washington Examiner he joins us tonight Byron we're gonna use inside voices now so you just heard congressman Sherman who's sitting still right next I did say in effect it's not a big deal that the Hillary campaign paid for this dossier or that the Podesta group was lobbying on behalf of the yeah you like talk about we're gonna talk about yeah right was it a big deal yes it was a big deal but even before we had this revelation from The Washington Post that the DNC in the Hillary campaign had paid for the dossier even before we knew that I think you saw a shift in tone among Democrats away from collusion and start yelling about the tax bill no they were talking more they were talking about Russia's active measures in the campaign and Russia did have a campaign to influence our presidential election there's no doubt about that and indeed you see with the articles of impeachment are about obstruction of justice about the president's firing of James Comey in other words you get to a point where collusion doesn't matter so I have to prove that it's just that the president obstructed justice repainted the slogans on the barn we never said that yeah or just moving on but I think what has happened now is after an attempt to to paint Russian involvement as a one way street where the Russians were trying to hurt Hillary and help Trump and Trump was somehow dealing with them I think we've seen it's a much more complicated picture because it is a fact that this foreign agent the former British spy Christopher Steele did get information from Russians who are connected to the Kremlin you just look at the dossier the dossier has source a and source B and source C and they're identified as you know a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official or a former senior Russian intelligence official or a senior Russian financial official so it's not a secret that they're dealing with people who are in the Russian government connected to the Kremlin so what has changed now is we're now seeing these democratic efforts to get dirt on Trump from Russia and that does sound suspiciously like what Donald Trump jr. thought he was gonna get in that June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower when some Russians had approached him and claimed to have had some sort of dirt on Hillary Clinton they didn't and that's not what the meeting was about but it's very similar here interesting we still the Congress would you would you like to July articles of impeachment have always been about obstruction of justice it's not the crime it's the cover-up we've got three different instances of violation of section 1512 they do not rump colluded or he did include he tried to stop the investigation are you a little embarrassed tell me you're a little bit embarrassed by these room I'm not eggs barest at all what I'm embarrassed we're not here talking about impeaching the president stopping a bath think are important yes things that are important to the American president what's their tax bill not whether the last candidate for president had a good campaign or they never campaign we've had silly as trying to say that Richard Nixon should be in office now we're back sighs you have dirt on George Lucas all of it that's insane thank you very much you'll roast the Acacia let me just ask you quickly given the performance you just saw from Congressman if Democrats were to take control of the House of Representatives in the midterm election a little more than a year from yeah how long would it take do you think to impeach sighs yeah I actually I think that's a bit of a fuzzy question because go back to 2006 george w bush's poll numbers are in the in the tank and it looks like democrats are gonna win the house which they do but early on in in the election before the election john conyers who stood to become the chairman of the visionary committee was talking about impeaching President Bush there was a lot of talk from the left wing of the Democratic Party about impeaching Bush so much so that prior to the election Nancy Pelosi who stood to become speaker came out and said impeachment is off the table right because they didn't want the election to be about impeachment and if you have a lot of talk about these articles of impeachment coming up to next year that's a good point look what could have talked about the commercial wing I'll read the tease the post weinstein backlash against sexual harassment is consuming a top political analyst at MSNBC but what are the risk of accountability turning into witch-hunt more right-wing take on this will right will come up right out of the commercial thank you

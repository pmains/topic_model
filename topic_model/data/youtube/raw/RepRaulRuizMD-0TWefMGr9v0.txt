Oh dr. Ruiz Thank You chairman Benishek and ranking member brownlee for holding this hearing and thank you to the panelists for your participation last Congress I was proud to come together with committee members in both chambers to streamline the VA's payment processing systems as the VA implements this centralized processing and payment system for all V a fee basis care we must ensure that the focus remain on the veterans that inefficient reimbursement does not hamper veterans access to services make it harder for veterans to seek answers from the VA or expose veterans to financial harm in this vein the VA must make certain that veterans are held harmless from any problems the agency has paying its bills which are certainly no fault of our veterans Vietnam veteran in my district a good friend of mine who has been approved to obtain one hundred percent fee basis care for more than a decade still reports frequent delays in VA payments to his providers when unpaid by the VA these bills go to collection agencies which can damage the veterans credit rating and expose the veteran too stressful harassment from collection agencies and to financial harm so mr. Migliaccio in the interest of preventing veterans from enduring similar struggles what safeguards are in place to prevent veterans from incurring financial harm poor credit ratings because of delayed VA reimbursements to fee basis care providers thanks I'll start we want to put some systems in place so it doesn't get to where the veteran is harmed at all so we want to start from the front end and that is in terms of developing a really a solid system and I won't get into this now we get to take the time but I'm going to focus on our people and we're going to focus on business processes and I want to look at technology also so we can prevent this from getting too okay so in other words you're going to prevent it by improving yes or your reimbursements however you have hundreds if not hundreds of thousands of veterans out there who already have poor credit ratings because of the VA's fault and no fault of their own so what are you gonna do about them well I i I've looked at the the issue and I've looked at the information we've provided back to your office I don't know if it's the the the extent of the issue is there it's not as severe as we think because our relationship is really with a provider and of a provider time out time out this amount when you say it's not as severe as you think now I know that you're thinking as an epidemiologist and you're looking at the big picture and a systemic white but for one veteran who has his credit rating is makes makes it a matter of whether he could pay rent or not it is severe yes sir so for those veterans whether it's 12 10 20 who are barely making ends meet if you're not paying their bills and they're getting poor credit ratings they could be evicted and then you've just increased your homeless veteran problem right so what mechanisms can you do to remedy that poor credit rating well one veteran being affected is one too many we've got some some situations in place right now we will go on behalf and work with our veterans if this situation arises we will work with the providers that sent the bills so we can adjudicate those claims quickly and check and check that out we also will write letters to credit agencies to clear up credit reports for occasions so I will I would like you to commit to working with this one veteran so that we can use that as a case study and you can demonstrate what you can do not only for this veteran for the other veterans the other issue that i want to touch on is that i'm very concerned about what just transpired here Mr Cook said that there are millions if not billions of dollars left unpaid and prior to that you had said that there are no outstanding claims so there is some serious discrepancies between what Mr Cook said and what you're saying so if you don't identify a problem you're not even going to attempt to fix it so if there are and he can show you exactly samples of late payments so what are you going to commit to do to remedy and rectify this discrepancy well I'll definitely work with mr. cookin as for the information that he is brought forward and and we'll see how we can work I did my research with the Veterans Health Administration to ensure that they were not staying claims there if there are I like to take a look at okay so we're going to fix that ok I will follow up with you and mr. cook to make sure that these different examples are are handled in a timely fashion so that we could get an example maybe build some trust with our new administrator here that he can demonstrate to us that things may change so this is going to be a trust exercise between you and this committee is that is that ok I'm on ok I yield back my time

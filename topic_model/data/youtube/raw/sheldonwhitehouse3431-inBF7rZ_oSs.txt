as president I ask unanimous consent that Lea Reuben shanna science fellow my office be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the Congress without objection mr. president if I might just make an inquiry about the order here I believe senator Whitehouse and I were about to engage in a colloquy the senator from Delaware is recognized for purposes of equality Howard Lee president mr. president I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island for up to 20 minutes is there objection without objection mr. president I am so pleased today to join my colleague the senator from Rhode Island to discuss one of the most important issues facing future generations and our world that's climate change an issue that also affects both of our coastal and low-lying states directly many may know Delaware status is the first state to ratify the Constitution but few of my colleagues I think are aware that Delaware is also our country's lowest-lying state we have the lowest mean elevation and this status comes with certain challenges especially from nearly 400 miles of exposed shoreline that means no part of our state is more than 30 miles from the coast so the good news is no matter where you live in my home state takes you less than 30 minutes to get the sun and sand but the challenge is we are particularly vulnerable to the increasing effects of climate change in recent years we've seen how flooding can devastate homes and communities up and down our state low-lying neighborhoods that often don't have the resources to cope with steadily increasing flooding like southbridge in Wilmington pictured to my right here are disproportionately affected environmental justice has long been a concern of mine and of Senator white houses and we had an opportunity to visit the neighborhood of South Bridge which every time it rains more than an inch or two is significantly flooded and with subsidence the steady sinking of the land and with sea level rise acting in combination on my home state we are simply going to see more and more challenges from severe flooding due to sea level rise around the globe and in my home state it's not just houses and neighborhoods that are threatened by sea level rise it's also businesses and entire industries there's a broad range of long-established industries and businesses in my state that placed in coastal areas because of the history of our settlement and development somewhere between 15 and 25 percent of all the land use for heavy industry in my state will likely be inundated by sea level rise by the end of the century that doesn't even include all the other productive land use for agriculture tourism that contributes jobs and revenue to my home state but despite our small size and our significant exposure we also punch above our weight when it comes to tackling the challenges of climate change in places like South Bridge our communities have come together at the state and local level to find creative solutions to cope with the flooding that is increasingly caused by climate change this image here demonstrates a plan that's been developed for the south wilmington wetlands project a senator whitehouse may describe in more detail his visit to the state of Delaware but I I wanted to open simply by describing this community response to the flooding that you saw on the previous slide we've come together as a community to plan a cleanup of a brownfield area to create a safe and attractive park for the neighborhood and to improve water quality and drainage in a way that also creates new ecosystems new opportunities for recreation and a new future for a community long blighted and often underwater and that's not the only example of many of actions that have been taken by my home state of Delaware Delaware also participates in Reggie the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative a collection of nine mid-atlantic and northeastern states including Rhode Island that have joined together to implement market-based policies to reduce emissions since 2009 the participating states have reduced our carbon emissions by twenty percent while also experiencing stronger economic growth in the rest of the country which I view as proof that fighting climate change and strengthening our economy are not usually exclusive goals in fact over the past six years Delaware has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions more than any state the entire United States we've done that by growing our solar capacity six thousand percent through multiple utility-scale projects and distributed solar we've also done our best to adapt to climate change through community and state lead planning our governor jack markell and the former Denver ex-secretary Collin O'Mara led a fantastic bottom-up statewide level planning effort to address the impacts of climate change water on agriculture and ecosystems infrastructure and public health and in December of 2014 they released their climate framework for Delaware an impressive statewide effort to be prepared for what's coming before it's too late della or then I think as an example of how communities most vulnerable to climate change can work together across public and private sectors to meet the challenge of climate change head-on that's why I invited my friend and colleague senator Whitehouse a true leader in the work to address climate change not only in his home state of Rhode Island but across our country to come and visit my state every week senator Whitehouse gives a speech on a different aspect of climate change I was proud to participate today in his weekly speech on the topic and thrilled to welcome him to my home state in May as part of his ongoing effort now before I yield the floor to Senator Whitehouse I just want to tell you about one other stop on our statewide tour stop in prime hook one of dollars to national wildlife refuges the beach at prime hook over the last 60 years has receded more than 500 feet and over the last decade storms have broken through the dune line several times flooding 4,000 acres of previously freshwater marsh when Hurricane sandy then hit this already fragile shoreline leaving this coastline battered as you can see through this image here it broke through completely and permanently flooded and destroyed the freshwater marsh the storm deepen and widen the breach from 300 feet to about 1,500 feet and exacerbated routine flooding on local roads used by the community to access the beach for a delicate ecosystem like this Wildlife Refuge this type of severe weather and flooding can be devastating and over the last three years the US Fish and Wildlife Service has worked in tandem with other federal agencies state partners and NGOs to restore this highly damaged fragile ecosystem and rebuild the beaches defenses it's a long story but you can see the punch line here which is that it as of March 2016 constructions been completed of a newly designed re sloped re developed a barrier which senator Whitehouse also had the opportunity to visit and the finished project here is going to be a saltwater marsh that I'm confident will contribute significantly to a durable resilient long-term ecosystem this is just one example of the creative things we're doing in Delaware to address the impacts of imma change and sea level rise but in some ways I think the most important and exciting was the last stop in our statewide visit so with that I'll turn it over to my colleague senator Whitehouse to discuss in more detail his visit to the state of Delaware and our last visit in the saw the most part of our state president senator from Rhode Island Thank You senator Coons I'm really grateful to the junior senator from Delaware for inviting me to his home state and for joining me here today for time to wake up speech 139 senator Coons and I spent a terrific day touring the Delaware shore you can say what you want about us but on that day we were the two wettest members of the United States Senate I can assure you of that this is Capitol Hill oceans week mr. president and Wednesdays world oceans day so it's a good time to consider the effects of global climate change in our oceans the oceans have absorbed a third of all carbon dioxide produced since the Industrial Revolution and over ninety percent of the excess heat that has resulted that means that by laws of both physics and chemistry the oceans are warming rising and acidifying Rhode Island is the ocean state but give Delaware credit it generated around a billion dollars in over twenty three thousand jobs from the ocean from the last report in 2013 from tourism recreation shipping and fishing and like Rhode Island Delaware sees its sea level rise at a rate of three and a third millimeters per year along the Delaware shore 13 inches up over the last hundred years and delawareans care about this over a quarter have reported personally experiencing the effects of sea level rise two-thirds that they worry about the effects of sea level rise and over seventy percent call on the state to take immediate action to combat climate change and sea level rise I did enjoy our visit in south wilmington i did enjoy the visit to port may and where the road has had to be built up with riprap to protect against sea level rise but the real prize and the prime reason that i went was Portman's avian connection among the sandpipers ruddy turnstone Zand goals that we saw in the shore was a bird called the rufa red not red not stand out from other shore birds on the beach not only from their colorful burnt orange plumage but from the amazing story that accompanies their arrival in Delaware each spring this is a story to love and I guess you'd have to say a bird to admire they only have about a 20 inch wingspan at full growth and their bodies only about the size of a teacup but each spring these Red Knots undertake an epic nine thousand plus mile voyage from terra del fuego on the southern tip of South America all the way up to the Canadian Arctic after spending the summer nesting in the Arctic the birds then make the return trip south to winter in the southern hemisphere this little bird has one of the longest animal migrations of any species on earth how does Delaware come into this well the Red Knots fly straight from Brazil to Delaware Bay and as you can imagine when they get there they are hungry they've lost as much as half their weight we were told they actually start ingesting their own organs towards the end for fuel well Delaware Bay is the largest horseshoe crabs spawning area in the world each May and June horseshoe crabs emerged from the seeds to lay millions of eggs nearly two million horseshoe crabs were counted in Delaware Bay in 2015 and a female horseshoe crab can lay up to 90,000 eggs per spawning season so do the math that's a lot of eggs and the Red Knots come here timed just so by mother nature to bulk up on those nutritious horseshoe crab eggs to replenish their wasted bodies from that long flight from Brazil the Delaware Bay and a fuel up for the 2,000 further miles of their journey into the Canadian Arctic well I wanted to see this natural wonder before it ends the US Fish and Wildlife Service lists the red not as threatened under the Endangered Species Act because an oft-quoted here successful annual migration and breeding of red knox is highly dependent on the timing of departures and arrivals to coincide with favorable food and weather conditions in the spring and fall migratory stopover areas and on the Arctic breeding grounds climate change can bollocks up that timing we are already seeing that in a different subspecies of red not that migrates north along the West African coast the journal science last month reported that earlier melting of Arctic snow is accelerating the timeline for hatching of insects leading to smaller birds the chicks less strong begin to we can get out of phase can't feed it successfully and it cascades through an array of further difficulties you actually have got to love this unassuming but astounding little bird but it's survival relies on a cascade of nature's events to line up just right Nature throws a long bomb from Tierra del Fuego and off go these birds and months later they arrive in Delaware Bay timed to this 450 million year old creature the horseshoe crab emerging from Delaware Bay to spawn if one environmental event comes too early or too late or if one food source becomes too limited the species could collapse we got a hint of that in the 1980s when horseshoe crabs became rarer because they were overfished as their numbers went down red not numbers fell in a chord if the changes were so recklessly putting in motion around the planet disturbed nature fateful timing the red knot could pay a sad price now some people may sneak her and say well there he goes again he's out on the Senate floor now he's talking about some stupid bird but i will say that when you see the voyage that this little bird has to make a little shorebird used to running along the shore making this epic voyage every year one of them has been measured back and forth because of the tag on its ankle to have flown the distance from here to the moon and half the way back in its life and if you can't see the hand of God in that creature mr. president I weep for your soul so I thank my colleague from Delaware for his staff and the experts who he brought along to help us learn about this like Rhode Island Delaware is being proactive in addressing the risks that we face and planning for a warmer and a wetter future and I returned to my time to the distinguished dad mr. president I just I want to conclude by commenting that our day together began and ended with citizen science the very first thing we did was to visit Delaware's National Park to participate in a BioBlitz where volunteers from all over the country we're identifying species and categorizing the threats to them from climate change and the very last thing we did was counting horseshoe crabs along a cape henlopen shore and I must say my colleague from Rhode Island even though there was driving rain and difficult conditions was passionate and determined to do everything we could to contribute to the counting effort of the horseshoe crabs that day it was a terrific opportunity for us to see a state that's engaged in planning and preparation and to witness one of the most remarkable migrations across our globe I just want to express in closing my gratitude to Senator Whitehouse where he's under a brushing up on this issue I'm sorry with the senator yield for a question senator will yield for a question were we indeed the two wettest senators that day we were in we were indeed the most persistently wet senators I suspect in the entire country by the end of a very very wet but very fulfilling day up and down the state of Delaware with that I'd like to thank my colleague from Rhode Island and mr. president I yield the floor

counter to president biden's repeated inauguration promise the dems have worked painstakingly to divide not unite our country from pushing critical race theory in our schools to hawking the idea that our country is inherently racist it's only a matter of time until the left comes after one of the most sacred institutions our military exhibit a maryland democratic congressman anthony brown who penned an op-ed in which he says quote the current military justice system is not serving our country's higher values of justice equity and fairness it has put service members of color at a disadvantage and left them subject to a commander-controlled system they do not trust joining us now for reaction is army veteran wesley hunt also a texas republican congressional candidate who says that he believes the left will eventually start calling for the defunding of the u.s military wesley thanks for joining us tonight great to see you happy to be here thank you for having me on well you know i think you're not too far off i wish i could say that i felt you were wrong about this but i want you to hear what squad member rashida talib had to say recently let's take a listen we must eliminate funding for cpp ice and their parent organization dhs time after time we have seen it as advocates on the ground as human services agency underground ground to continue to see over and over again that these agencies are inept to humanely guiding migrants through our immigration system and further continue instead they further continue to terrorize migrant communities your reaction sir we have seen this playbook over and over and over again it started off by dividing our country by race builder to defund the police and then now we're trying to divide our young people through critical race theory and then now we're moving to border patrol agents and then now we're moving to the military it is obvious and right now the military is a meritocracy it literally is one of the truest meritocracies that we have in the world our united states military is about performance it is about evaluation it is about how good of a warfighter are you regardless of your race religion color or creed so if they could crack this code if they can break us here to get to the point to where they make even our military divided along the lines of race then what are we going to have left we have got to stop the bleeding you know wesley hunt listen i certainly hear you on that point but it's not just some of the leftist loons from the squad who are actually calling for defunding the military there are some calls on the right and from some people who are pretty prominent within the america first movement now i think it's primarily a reaction against some of the awful leadership in the pentagon and i'll give you exhibit a here let's listen to general milly his terrible testimony it is important that we train and we understand and i i want to understand white rage and i'm white and i want to understand it so wesley i have no idea by the way what he was talking about there i've lived in this country as a minority my entire life i don't know what white rage he's talking about but here's my question to you i don't want to cut military funding but i do want a complete change of leadership at the pentagon and i think a lot of generals and a lot of admirals need to be shown the door do you agree yeah the disappointing thing about that is i don't know what he's talking about in terms of white rage either let's just talk about rage we are seeing violence throughout this entire country in all types of communities i think just a few weeks ago there were 40 people shot in chicago that's rage what about ms-13 pouring in our borders and other gangs that's also rage this is not just predicated to one specific group or one race or one gender how can we write the ship on rage generally speaking but really what i want to talk about especially with our military leaders is the importance of war fighting if we are dividing ourselves by race and talking about race and teaching that to our soldiers it's time not spent perfecting our craft to be the best war fighters we can be to protect our nation for the future that needs to be our only focus and i'm a west point guy my brother's a west point guy my sister's a west point gal in fact she went first in our family there's 60 years worth of military service in our family and the one thing we never talk about is race we talk about the man and woman to our left and our right and what are we going to do to do our job properly to make sure that we get home safely and make sure that we accomplish the mission that our country gave us to do that has nothing to do with race wesley we're pretty short on time but just want to get your reaction when you look at your time serving the military clearly you're very proud of that as you should be and we thank you for your service look at your time and look at where we see the military now where we see this woke takeover what are your thoughts again the focus has got to be on war fighting and getting the mission done and doing it together and when you're in the foxhole and where you're getting shot at nobody cares what your race religion color or creed may be the only thing that matters is that we are americans fighting for our nation that's got to be our sole focus wokeness belongs nowhere in our united states military and when i talk to my classmates and my friends we don't we don't talk about race we talk about service that's what this has got to be about i hope our generals in the at the pentagon get how imperative this is right we can go down a very slippery slope if we continue down this path it's my opinion that in 2022 we have got to take back the house in order to just put a stop and put an end to all of this craziness well wesley hunt best of luck in your campaign uh sounds like you are from a family of a lot of patriots the hunts thank you for your time tonight yes god bless you all thank you so much

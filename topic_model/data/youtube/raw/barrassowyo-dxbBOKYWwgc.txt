and we're joined now by the chair of the Senate Republican conference member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee John Barossa Senator thank you for joining us again this morning let me pick let's pick up where we just left off with Jake did you find his argument convincing for staying in the Iran nuclear talks no deal with Iran George is a good deal Iran is a straight as a state sponsor of terrorism they continue to claim death to America that we cannot allow them to have a nuclear weapon I've always felt this Administration was too eager for a nuclear deal or any deal with Iran I think we should not go forward with one if they do it needs to come to the senate for ratification this Administration wants to send tens of billions of dollars to Iran for a deal that I think is going to be a bad deal for America let's talk about Ukraine are Republicans prepared to keep giving Ukraine the resources they need to fight this war some of your Senate candidates like jade events in Ohio instead we've given Ukraine enough and Democratic senator Chris Murphy warned this week that the GOP will hold up additional Aid if you win control of Congress is he right no there continues to be bipartisan support in the house and in the Senate for weapons to Ukraine I thought President Biden actually was right at the United Nations when he told other world leaders they had a responsibility to do more in terms of weapons to Ukraine and condemning Russia because Putin will not stop George until he is stopped there's been bipartisan criticism of the administration for being too slow with weapons to Ukraine we need more advanced weapons including these Advanced drones and and missile systems Vladimir Putin continues to use energy as a weapon both to fund his military and to punish Europe for not standing with him that's been a criticism I've had of this Administration and its energy policies we ought to be producing more American Energy to help our European allies also to help get prices down at home which is why I think the president's numbers in your ABC News poll that just came out are so terrible on the economy let me ask you the question I asked Jake Sullivan at the outset do you believe that Putin's hold on power is secure I'm not sure he is in a deep hole right now and he's dug this hole and I thought his statement to the country there uh really was desperate I didn't show really confidence or strength and desperate people do desperate things and that's why I think we've seen this nuclear threat I think we have to continue to supply Ukraine with the weapons that they need and not be intimidated by this threat the Foreign Relations Committee is going to have a hearing this Wednesday on what additional things we can do in terms of sanctions and also we have a secure briefing on Thursday in the in the Senate to take a look right at what's happening on the ground in Ukraine but I will tell you George China is watching closely and what we do will have an impact on what China decides to do with regard to Taiwan and we have seen them pushing back a bit against pluton as well I want to ask you about the investigation of Donald Trump's handling of classified information even though his lawyers have provided no evidence that he Declassified the documents the Trump said this week that as president he could declassify documents by thinking about it do you agree with that I've not heard that one before George like I tell you in terms of National Security documents we have to always use Extreme Caution I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee we deal with classified information all of the time and are always very careful I don't know what a what anything about the rules for when a president declassifies documents and information what I do know is what I'd like to see from a senate standpoint is I'd like to see the Department of Justice come to us and show us in a classified setting what the information is what they've done I thought this the rate at the former president's home never seen anything like that before clearly and has become political so I want to get a briefing so that we can then be informed to see what actually happened here that that was a rhetorical question you know that a president can't declassify documents by thinking about it why can't you say so yeah I don't think a president can declassify documents by saying so by thinking about it Senator Brasa thanks for joining us this morning thank you

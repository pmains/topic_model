we now to talk about all this Democratic member of Congress Karen bass of California representative thank you so much for being with us have you read by the way the Republican memo no no no and I'm not on the House Intelligence Committee I'm on House Foreign Affairs however they have made it public available to every member of Congress to read it should they want to rewrite now based on what you know is inside it and based on your role on judiciary do you think that this is the type of memo that should be released well I think it would be fine to release the memo but you know I do believe that the Republicans are really treading and dangerous ground when they are using this as a reason to essentially undermine the investigation and at the end of the day it's definitely to go after Muller so I don't like the direction that they're headed I think the investigation should be allowed to move forward and concocting a conspiracy within the FBI I believe is a complete distraction you say it's an effort to go after Muller do you think do you think the special counsel needs legislative protections right now am i doing that has been proposed I do I think that that would be a good idea and to me it's very similar to the legislation that was done around sanctions regarding Russia and we're going to wait and see what happens with that but because Congress did not have the confidence in the President to impose sanctions you know we did legislation that essentially we could override a veto but I think that in the same way we need to have that protection because no telling what the president is going to do one day to the next the deadline on those sanctions and you mention in the house corner I know also the deadline on that sanction is today and we're waiting we're waiting to find out you know where the president if the president places these sanctions by the end of business today let's shift gears if we can to tomorrow night the State of the Union address is tomorrow night will you be attending you know I haven't decided if I don't go it's not as an act of protest if I choose not to go it's really because I don't know whether or not I feel like subjecting myself to listen to the president lie which I believe he will do and also to insult everybody under the Sun I'm sure he will be insulting immigrants with the policy that he's going to put forward and I have no doubt that he come after african-americans since he seems to take every opportunity to do that so so let's split that into parts right so first let's talk about immigrants right now because I imagine what he will do is he will speak out in support of his plan right now on the immigration deal he's supporting which does offer a path to citizenship for more than one and a half million so-called dreamers a path to citizenship which is a lot further than some Republicans want to go if Democrats don't enter into this deal how would you explain to one of those dreamers that you walked away from it well I do think that part of his deal is fine but I think that where we need to negotiate is over dreamers and border security what he has done and I believe it's very deliberate instead of proposing comprehensive immigration reform he's going after legal immigration as part of it as well so to it to put family unification and to put visa lottery on the table that is a very intentional attempt to divide people because the visa lottery system which clearly he doesn't understand the the a large percentage of those immigrants are from Africa and so he is dividing people it's very deliberate I think we need to deal with the issues which are the dreamers and border security and then I think we need to address comprehensive immigration reform and that's where issues related to legal immigration should come to play all right let's talk about race because you brought it up directly and let's talk about I think what is the most recent episode having to do with race where the president was involved and it just happens to be about something that happened on CNN with jay-z you the musician you know hip-hop artist who was on with Van Jones over the weekend listen to the exchange between van and jay-z over the issue of black unemployment which is add an historic low listen because it's not about money at the end of the day money is not doesn't equate to like happiness it does it is that's that's not missing the whole point you treat people like human beings and then you know that's - that's the main point you can't treat someone like yes it goes back to the whole thing you're gonna treat me really bad and pay me well it's not gonna lead to happiness it's gonna lead to like you know again the same thing everyone's gonna be sick so the president's response was a statement on Twitter that reads somebody please inform jay-z that because of my policies black unemployment has just been reported to be the lowest rate ever recorded now black unemployment is in fact low it is but it I believe it has absolutely little to do with his administration we all know that the economy was doing better it was on an upswing black unemployment was decreasing and it was due to policies that were started in the Obama administration Trump from the first day of his presidency has tried to roll back gains that the African American population made in the civil rights movement whether you're talking about voting rights mass incarceration you can go down the list trying to dismantle the civil rights division within the Department of Justice the notion of black identity extremists to go after young African Americans who are protesting around police abuse so his administration in my opinion has been an attack on the African American population from day one and he doesn't let a month go by without attacking African Americans so I think he wants us to be grateful for the fact that our unemployment rate is down even though it is still twice as high as the unemployment rate for white Americans and the fact that the economy is getting better I do not believe it's due to his policies and I don't think that we have anything to be grateful for to his administration all right representative Karen bass thanks so much for being with us appreciate it

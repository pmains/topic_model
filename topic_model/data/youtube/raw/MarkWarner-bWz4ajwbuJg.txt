well joining us now Democratic senator Mark Warner of Virginia he's chairman of the Senate intelligence committee and to Willie's Point Senator uh we were talking earlier with Admiral Kirby about this it seems Vladimir Putin has been in a corner uh and everyone talks about what the off-ramp is How This Ends obviously most people would like this to end with Russia moving back out of Ukraine and yet he consent continues to push himself more into a corner almost without indiscriminately without any thought for himself about an off-ramp with a war that is going terribly for him well how do you deal with a leader that doesn't seem to care that he's in a corner carefully yeah no this is a guy that's been an autocratic leader for 20 plus years in the coveted environment his number of advisors he's talking to get smaller and smaller you've seen not only the Russian military perform horribly on the field you have seen a United West you've seen NATO and our allies in Asia all stand up against it and now with this conscription you know what's not it's gotten some public reporting but they Russia has lost over 200 000 military age men exiting the country people leaving they're being conscripted so how he maintains that it's a disaster to see the attacks nobody's attacking the boss yet nobody's attacking Putin but the folks around the boss um some of his military advisors they're under constant assault as well with from within Russia but that seems dicey too so what scares you the most about a cornered Vladimir Putin because things aren't going to get better for Russia things are not going to get better and I think this is why you know there's a lot of things I disagree with the administration on but moving Us in concert with our European allies has been really important the solidarity of NATO is really important what happens next we're in an Uncharted Territory the next month between now and when the winner sets in in the middle of November we hope the ukrainians will be able to take Kirsten and drive the Russian troops back across the Nipper River but it's going to be a wild few weeks any suggestion that they're that when winter comes when things freeze in place that negotiations can begin again I think there's some speculation is there a fully thought through plan absolutely not and again with every Ukrainian success frankly the maneuverability of zelinski the Ukrainian president gets mitigated as well yeah you say it's going to be a wild few weeks because once you get mid-november at least for the next few months because of the winter it will troops will freeze in place in a sense and you know we've then we'll see also some of the ramifications of will the Europeans stay strong when their energy costs go through the roof one of the reasons why frankly you know would be good National policy as well as economic policy we ought to continue to make sure American Oil and Gas yeah are in this mixture why we need to do go ahead and revisit permitting reform so that particularly in terms of American Natural Gas we can supply that Supply rather than counting on friends or not so good friends in the Middle East right Jonathan beers in New York and it has a question for you I hope he has a question for you Senator Warren good to see you there's been a debate now in Washington as you well know for several months about U.S sending enough weapons to Ukraine to defend itself but not so much that it could perhaps escalate the war with incursions or attacks deep into Russian the wake of what happened over the weekend U.S officials are saying hey we're going to send more defense weapons but still seem to hesitate going further than that despite Kiev asking for it where do you stand what sort of weapons should the United States be sending Jonathan I think we should send more anti-missile defense weapons but I do think we've got to walk this careful line where you don't give carte blanche to the ukrainians to have additional strikes into Russia itself and at the same time you've got to not get so ahead of the Europeans that they all all of a sudden say Okay America you put up 65 billion dollars we're going to make you carry the whole burden so I do think this is a a navigation of a very very challenging time and on this one I give the administration a high marks Mr chairman uh let me ask you about one of your colleagues in the Senate a fellow chairman of the senate for Foreign Relations Committee Bob Menendez on the topic of Saudi Arabia who after Saudi Arabia's announcement of opec's Opex plus handling of oil prices and the barrels of oil that they release or won't release said basically we need to freeze our relationship with Saudi Arabia including arms sales says they're under they're underwriting Russia's War they're backing Russia against Ukraine do you agree with him that we need to freeze our relations with Saudi Arabia listen I'm as angry at Saudi Arabia and their irresponsibility as anyone but I think even as you guys said on this show yesterday you know the truth is certain areas obviously we have huge conflicts with Saudi in other areas as a counterbalance to Iran in terms of any being an ally over many decades we've got to sort this through in a way that puts pressure on the Saudis but does not drive them more into the Russia Camp one of the things I think would be yeah and I don't think this would mean backing off from our climate change goals but if we can replace some of those fuel sources coming out of the Middle East with American fuel sources particularly as we transition to clean our energy generation I think that's good National Security that's good Economic Security and it would be a tangible pushback against the Saudis and shouldn't we have more uh for for national security purposes and also so we're less dependent absolutely shouldn't we increase energy production in the United States understanding let me say my friends understanding we're in the middle of an energy transition right now but we have the ability to be less dependent on Russia to be less dependent on Sovereign these people that are talking about oh we can't drill at home because it's bad for the environment let's get dirty oil from Venezuela Joe is particularly let's go back to natural gas for a moment we don't even need to drill more if we simply utilize what we've already drilled we've got to have the transmission capability to get that to places in our country and frankly to be able to export to our European friends you're going to see costs I've been told in January in the UK where an average home will get five thousand dollar per month energy cost now the British government will subsidize that bring it back down to a reasonable number but how long can any government do that uh with a very cold winter in front of them yeah and let's talk about China how do they play into uh what's happening right now in Russia and trying to bring that word I think you've got the Chinese economic team who are concerned about this Alliance or friendship that has no bounds I think she and Putin said it does have bounds but but that's personal relationship between these two autocratic leaders is a real challenge for all of us who live in democracies and I think the long-term challenge of our time candidly is not Russia but it is going to be China's attempt to dominate Technology field after Technology field we in this country has stepped up on semiconductors we've pointed out the problems with Huawei in terms of Next Generation Wireless I know my committee is taking a big look at synthetic biology and Next Generation energy generation and making sure that we in our our country make sure we maintain the technology Edge and that's going to take the kind of Investments perhaps in other domains the way we just did in semiconductors all right chairman of the Senate intelligence committee Democratic senator Mark Warner

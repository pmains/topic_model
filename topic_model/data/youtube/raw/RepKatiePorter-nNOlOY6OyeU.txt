families across the country are struggling to keep up with rising gas prices in orange county california the price of gas is nearly six dollars a gallon and the price has gone up two dollars a gallon in just one year as a single working mom i see the difference every time i fill up the tank for my minivan i know that higher gas prices are painful for everyone in our country and especially burdensome for families with limited transportation options and tight budgets these higher gas prices are also pushing up the costs for small businesses and grocery stores contributing to the higher prices that families are paying for everything from food to furniture orange county families need congress to hold oil companies accountable when they use their market power to unfairly raise prices these corporations are making record profits the highest that they have been in over seven years even as americans are struggling they plan to use these profits to buy back over 35 billion dollars in stock rather than investing in production to increase supply transitioning to green energy or bringing down the price at the pump the oil and gas industry currently has more than 9 000 permits to drill for oil on federal land but they are deliberately keeping production low to please their investors and increase their short-term profits even when the price of crude oil falls oil and gas companies have refused to pass those savings on to consumers let me be clear price gouging is anti-capitalist it exploits a lack of competition which is a hallmark of capitalism it is an effort to juice corporate profits at the expense of customers energy markets are reeling because of russians and russia's invasion of ukraine big oil companies however are using this temporary chaos to cover up their abuse congress cannot just allow this profiteering to continue two weeks ago representative schreier and i introduced the consumer fuel price gouging act to give our federal trade commission the authority to crack down on oil and gas companies that increase prices unfairly current anti-trust law prohibits price fixing but there is nothing in the law to stop price gouging by individual companies this bill would close that loophole and i urge my colleagues to pass this bill

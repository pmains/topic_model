very full weekend in which i focused exclusively on the water distribution system with the navy over the last two days i've met with senior leadership of our navy as well as our army i have spoken with governor ige with mayor blanchardi with director char with the folks at the university of hawaii who have done some of the testing and the evaluation of the testing i have personally visited the affected neighborhoods both at aliamanu a military reservation as well as a down at halsey terrace i've talked to residents in their homes i have visited the army's emergency response center in the amanu i visited red hill elementary school i've tried to understand this every which way i can over the last few days we've had discussions with the navy throughout this time and i've been in direct communication with my colleagues on the congressional delegation as well throughout this is not obviously our first effort in this area we collectively uh have asked the navy twice in the last month on a formal basis to review its operations around red hill and its fuel distribution system in the communities served by the navy which as you all know at this point are not just navy but army coast guard air force as well as civilian contractors anybody on our on our military bases the delegation met with secretary of the navy del toro personally i mean by zoom but the four of us on the phone with him just a week ago to try to communicate the urgency of the situation to the highest levels of of the navy and you will all have secretary del toro here in a few days we have urged him to publicly talk to you to the media uh to the community um i hope he takes that advice um and and so obviously we are extremely concerned as is everybody else so let me give you a couple of observations um and areas that i think we definitely all need to work on together so number one um our number one priority has to be the residents that are affected these are our brothers and sisters uh most of them are in our military as long as they're here in hawaii they are our ohana and they're my constituents um and we have to do what we can they've they have suffered direct consequences they have become sick their pets have died they have been dislocated they have questions across the board they have needs and they have long-term concerns perhaps they are sick now and uh they have recovered but uh what does that mean down the road for them these are real concerns and that has to be number one um and um i think it is in fact number one to the folks that are involved uh certainly um the the folks um that have been affected um are getting direct um assistance now from from their military as well as us by the way uh we we have um great people uh in our military working today yesterday and tomorrow to take care of the folks that need to be taken care of we have tried to help them i just spoke with mayor blanchardi by arranging you know hotel rooms where they can stay they have real world needs in terms of for example how do they get their children from waikiki hotels to schools during the day and so [Applause] they have to be number one i think number two we have to understand exactly what happened why it happened when it happened where it happened and how to prevent it from happening again this is the immediate concern and we don't have that answer yet we have done a variety of testing through the navy obviously you all know that the department of health has done its own testing and some of the media stations have done a testing and that testing continues today but to date there is no conclusive widely accepted answer to what happened when why how and how to prevent it we've had inconclusive we've had we've certainly seen petroleum products uh in some amounts in some of the tests but it has not been confirmed if that is you know fuel including red hill fuel or whether it's some other a petroleum product such as such as you know motor oil or any number of other things that could account for petroleum testing we have thus far tested fairly narrowly to try to determine whether in fact this was fuel but we have not gone to broader testing yet we being again the navy the department of health and others to determine whether in fact what what other causes there may be i think we are all operating on some working assumption that this is somehow connected uh to the leaks at red hill at on november 20th and probably earlier but thus far we don't have that as far as i can determine at least nobody has told me yes we all agree that's exactly what happened now we obviously have to figure this out because we have to figure out how to mitigate it and how to contain it and how to eliminate it especially as we see our military families and ohana going back into their homes which we hope will happen and this is not an this is not an idle uh concern because um there's only you know uh there there there are certain certainly we're going to take care of them as long as it takes uh but clearly we and they want these answers to return to any semblance of a normal life and so those are the two main priorities that i think we all have to pursue right now now there's some broader things that are going on that i believe need to be said number one obviously our trust in our navy to operate not only the red hill fuel tanks but the entire navy water distribution system has been seriously compromised at this point if not broken and so to expect the navy itself to determine exactly what happened and why and to decide what to do about this i don't think is acceptable uh it does have to involve a broader range of evaluation of oversight of expertise of of looking over the navy's shoulder and we are pursuing that at the congressional delegation that is why we asked the navy to uh appoint its inspector general to review the operations of of of red hill in some respects and the inspector general is the independent arm of the navy has no accountability at all to the navy leadership we may want to go further than that and have independent evaluations from outside just the inspector general but somehow we have to get to the bottom of not only what happened and why but how to prevent it and how to deal with longer term concerns number two in that connection one of the critical failings to date has been a lack of coordination among the navy the department of health the environmental protection agency and others to muster the resources and information and collective expertise and resources to be able to figure out what happened why and how and this is primarily from my view viewpoint a a problem with the navy the navy has not been forthcoming immediately forthcoming with test results and with other information requested by the state of hawaii and by the epa and that is a critical failing that we cannot accept anymore communicated this directly to admiral paparo we have communicated that to the higher levels of of the navy at this point that the idea that this is your problem exclusively and you get uh to to to um you know review you review the uh possibilities and to and to figure out what to do about it and to implement on your own without including everybody else anybody else is not acceptable and so on a very very clear observation we need a far different construct for how the testing is performed what kind of testing is performed and immediate transparency and distribution of results everybody has has an interest in what these results are and only if we act collectively can we get to the bottom of this as soon as possible and i expect to communicate that further and to take action along those lines as much as i can and i believe the delegation as well to make that happen that definitely has to happen immediately we obviously once we take care of the immediate priorities which is our ohana and what happened and why and to try to address this issue to certainly go back to the bigger picture questions about red heel fuel tank again i don't know as i sit here i don't have a clear indication as i said here but whether into what extent the leaks at red hill over the last couple of months including just a few weeks ago do have a causal connection again working assumption is hey if you have a leak at red hill and people get sick 10 days after that or less there is a connection but we haven't demonstrated that yet so we need to get through that and figure that out but there is a broader problem with red hill as we all know at this point a problem really as the delegation spoke uh just the other day in our joint statement of two days ago we called it an organizational crisis issue that the navy has run red hill fuel tanks and its distribution system i'm in an atmosphere that simply has increasingly not inspired public confidence has made us all feel that it's risk calculation and we all know that red hill is in fact critical to our national security there is no question about that but if the calculation of preserving a national security asset presents unacceptable risk to us to our drinking water to our to our lives that's not a risk that i or anybody else is willing or should be asked to accept and so the question is uh can we in fact take red hill uh to a zero risk tolerance profile under which we can feel comfortable uh with any kind of an operation there and maintain our national security and that question has to be reviewed anew and answered and if the answer is that they cannot eliminate risk then red hill should not continue we're obviously going down the road on several avenues along those lines whether it be secondary containment whether it be integrity of the pipelines i and the delegation have have asked for these fun for the funding for all of this and and actually not just asked but mandated uh the increased uh standard testing the increased uh improvements at red hill we did that even before this incident and we're still obviously continuing that right now but it also takes the department of defense to substantially ramp up its prioritization of red hill and and addressing legitimate concerns with its operation thus far the department of defense has not sufficiently prioritized red hill in my view and by prior to prioritizing it i refer to actually including it in its budgetary requests actually fighting for it inside the president's budget inside the office of management and budget these are the things that have to happen where we're well positioned as a delegation to to um require these items with two of us on the armed services committee and two of us on the appropriations committee but as we have all said directly to the secretary of uh the navy and to our senior military leadership it is not acceptable for you to expect us to do this as a congressional delegation when you're not going to do it up front as a department of defense so either do that or don't expect us to support you at this point would you say to the people who uh might have gone along with the double line tanks but now after seeing what's happened with the navy's residential area and the navy's own families that we need to drain those tanks and move them well i think first of all what we know so far is that in this particular situation the tanks are not the issue there's no there's no nobody's saying that there was any causal connection to the tanks themselves if there was a connection it had to do with the pipelines that move fuel to and from those tanks what i'm saying is we have to focus on the immediate crisis which is uh help the families and and stabilize the immediate situation and then we do have to ask those questions i mean secondary containment if and as we continue red hill in any way shape or form has to be part of that solution i can i cannot envision any solution for red hill under which we would not provide for secondary containment but clearly that has to be on the table congressman what do you think about some complaints that have been made for the department of justice going back to 2014 to investigate the navy's handling of the red hills specifically their communication with environmental regulators the state department of health what do you think doj should conduct an independent probe about the navy who's handled fuel storage up there well i think that uh somebody needs to conduct an independent uh review of the navy's operations at uh red hill overall um and so um i believe that the inspector general is one place to start not the only place uh clearly um the department of justice is not equipped uh to do that from uh from a pure scientific engineering operational perspective but certainly if the if if any such review by the inspector general reveals any kind of wrongdoing in any kind of you know lack of statutory compliance in the operation of red hill they should be referred to the department of justice for for action some people say that the navy is being more reactive than proactive in a situation during your tour did you see them more kind of reacting to providing water or were they being like kind of more proactive like this is what's going to be done this is how we're going to fix it in the future my observation is the navy has has definitely been deficient in terms of its basic crisis management here i think they i think they they obviously were caught flat-footed um when when the the when the leaks um when the complaints first came from their communities they they they have not reacted as fast as comprehensively as as involved in the community as they should have i think they're doing better now so i do want to recognize that they are taking this seriously that they they have tried to adjust um they're really having to pursue really two things at the same time number one is crisis management and and helping their families and number two finding out uh what exactly happened and why and and how and to develop a plan because they're the ones that are responsible for this system the army has done a tremendous job of crisis management as any of you who have been to the amanu can can attest i mean they've got their stuff together uh they're but they are dependent on the navy uh for for this solution and so certainly one observation um uh that i come away with is is any any silos in the services as to hey the navy is going to do this and you know the army's not going to get involved in that those silos have to fall away immediately and in fact i have observed in the last couple of days that that has happened uh we have for example the navy welcoming the army into the navy housing i was down at um i was down at halsey terrace yesterday um and um i had there the navy operating water distribution i had the army operating some potable water supplies and i had the marines operating a a mobile laundry and shower facility for the residents that's what we need here everybody has to pony up and pitch in to get this job done in a crisis and and and the other thing that i think could have done been done a lot faster from a crisis management is the navy including everybody right off the bat in in really an emergency uh response they they really started out trying to do it themselves and that was never going to be possible in this situation you paid a visit to the facility following the november 20th release and the complaints about the fumes from the foster village and the iliamano residents what was the takeaway from that site visit my takeaway um i've been in red hill now three times um and um the first two times i went um at red hill you have an upper shaft which is across the tops of the tanks and you go you get a good sense in the upper shaft of the tanks themselves you go in one tank but what i hadn't done until that visit which i did with representative kahelle and our teams jointly i had not been in the lower shaft and that's where you have uh the pipeline infrastructure that's where you have we saw the site of of of of the of some of the the incidents in may as well as um we couldn't actually see where the suspected break was in the november 20th incident but when you get to the bottom shaft you realize that again red hill is not just about tanks it's about pipelines it's a it's an intricate infrastructure and um it is it is uh it is it is it is my takeaway was you got to take care of the whole ball of wax to focus on the things itself now that seems obvious but until you get there and look at them you you don't really get a sense of that and we we tracked exactly what the possibility was of that november 20th leak uh getting somehow into the air and water in the red hill shaft so i do understand how that could have happened but again um we don't have the demonstrated testing and and to just say yes that's exactly what happened so you have to rule out other possibilities for example i've talked to some people over the weekend not these are experts not affiliated with the navy who have speculated on whether this is related to the fuel tanks whether this is related to the actual water distribution system on pearl harbor itself we all know that pearl harbor and our military have been operating for decades now in a in you know in in various environmental regimes um now i think they operate pretty safely but you don't know what maybe you don't know and so we have to exhaust all possibilities and then there were some leaks into pearl harbor and we were told that these were uh older discharges oh what assurance is you know do you feel assured with what you're hearing about those incidents well i think i think the best answer is at this point i i don't feel assured of anything and you know that that's what trust is about if the navy told me something a couple years back about that okay fine but given given really what's happened in the last few months especially now as i said directly to the secretary of the navy look where i probably would have mostly trusted the navy now i just have to be skeptical i have to ask myself to review that independently i can't i can't just take you your word for it those particular leaks at um at the kilo pier kilo pier do appear to be related to not be related to red hill fuel tanks specifically there is a fairly large [Music] oil spill under that here and it appears uh that that was the source of those leaks um for both kilo and hotel yes do you think that any uh that possibly maybe any work that was done by heart along that guideway might have disturbed some of the older discharges in that area i mean i i've never heard that mentioned i know obviously that that heart crosses the red hill fuel line um uh right at uh right above the amanu as i recall um and so uh no that's not right it's it's it's in a different locations further down um so you can't i don't think you can rule anything out at this point we do have to figure this out i've never heard it brought up as a as a as a suspicion or as a as a working hypothesis by anybody congressman a lot of people are calling for red hill to be shut down it's an 80 year old facility and then maybe should transition into some other form of fuel storage you believe it's time to start winding down and close in the facility i certainly think we have to think about it i think we have to think it through again my focus right now is is the immediate crisis taking care of the the families taking care of the of trying to resolve what happened and get things stabilized uh i'm not i'm not at all prepared to to accept the proposition that that red hill must continue uh from uh from a national security perspective but i certainly believe that we've got to step back and ask all of those questions all over again uh to again see whether there is any um if there is if they're you know what the scenarios are can can the can the uh can the navy operate in a way that engenders public trust and and addresses national security concerns again my answer is if they can't then the answer is no you should start to wind red hill down but i do believe that we owe it all around to do that in a a very deliberative way uh certainly if if uh well i'll leave it at that if it does continue congressman does there need to be change improvements uh just in based on the discussions you've had absolutely there's no question about it i think um you know without significant change without significant improvements it's hard for me to imagine how you would be able to simply you know stabilize the situation today and then continue on with any kind of current status quo i think i think you know as i said earlier the first the first requirement would be a a an independent and trustworthy plan for reducing any risk at red hill at the red hill fuel containments number one number two i would certainly have to see the department of defense pony up on that like to come up with a plan and then not funded in the president's budget is not acceptable at all and then number three um i think that um that there there needs to be uh a far greater and more significant um oversight of the operation outside of the navy proper some some ability to to to look over the navy's shoulder because nobody has really looked over the navy's shoulder sufficiently to include the state and the state of hawaii is saying we're not we're not going to accept that anymore and i completely support the state of hawaii saying that and the epa as well and so let's not forget that that we have a crisis to handle right now and we need to get through this crisis we have a contested case hearing in action which is legitimately being continued for further facts and should continue until those facts are answered and we have a decision to make at the state level as to whether to allow that permit to con to to operate to continue and if so under what conditions and so this is our opportunity and this is where these questions um one place where these questions can been answered and i'm completely supportive of that process you know we're coming up on the eight year anniversary of the big field spell back in 2014 in your discussions you know with the military i mean we don't know where that fuel went i mean do they have any indication that maybe that's what's turned up in the water one of those questions that is unanswered right now from my perspective first of all was the cause of the the most of that fuel is accounted for as i recall i mean it's all but um there is some that's unaccounted for so i'm not going to say it's all accounted for and again i would say that's that's according to what the navy says so i think anything is is is fair game to to double check and ask for full validation and verification and independent analysis if if um if others feel that that's appropriate and i would hope the navy feels that's appropriate too um but again to to to ask you know naval facilities command uh to review itself at this point is not going to work there are you know to get into the weeds on this there's a lot we still don't know about the interaction of of any potential spills that red red hill with water movement and our aquifer for example we've had a long discussion with the navy about okay what if there was a feel discharged into the aquifer which direction would it move and what would we do about it and the navy's uh view of that is uh this is this would not be um you know a major issue because uh the plume would move uh you know towards pearl harbor and we'd be basically be able to suck it up and the state has disagreed with that and has asked for a trace uh test so that they could actually test that hypothesis the navy has has been resistant to that that's not going to be acceptable anymore you've got to cooperate with legitimate concerns about the operation and if you if you're not going to do that then then i don't see how you can continue it thanks thank you thank you congressman okay thank you

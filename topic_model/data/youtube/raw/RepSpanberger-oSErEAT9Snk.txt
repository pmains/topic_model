president biden spoke with his finnish and swedish counterparts today saying that he would support a decision by each country to join nato this of course comes amid russia's invasion of ukraine both countries are now weighing nato membership as it would be another layer of protection for them nothing is official yet but the president was asked about his conversations today spoke with both of the leaders of sweden and finland today what's your message to president putin after those essentially those threats that he gave at least defend them with regard to the second question i'm not going to go into the detail of my private conversations with the president of sweden and finland except that we had a good conversation and they expressed their interest and desires relating to security and the more to report on that shortly this all comes as a situation in ukraine only grows more dire officials predict mario poll could fall to russian troops in a matter of days ukraine is still pleading for more western aid and yesterday congress was poised to pass more bipartisan funding but because of senate rules a single senator rand paul was able to block it democrats including virginia representative abigail spanberger says that was unacceptable in regards to senator paul holding up this broad bipartisan piece of legislation that is meant to render aid support to the cause of the ukrainians fighting for their freedom it's shameful it's disgusting it's unthinkable and and frankly it signals greater problems within the united states senate that one singular person can do vladimir putin's bidding and preclude the will of the american people and the united states congress from being able to help and support our allies as they fight for their freedom

her husband was a 25-year veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress and committed suicide last year she created a foundation in his honor to help other veterans servicemen and women and their families improve their lives her son is an active-duty marine Amanda good afternoon mr. president um thank you for being here throughout my husband's military career he spent a lot of time overseas many many deployments and very very dangerous missions unfortunately on his last appointment they were under enemy attack and not everyone made it the things that my husband had to go through he had to live with after he came home he was diagnosed with PTSD but unfortunately like many of our servicemen and women this was his career this was his livelihood and he was too scared to go get help because he did not want to risk being labeled as unstable or a weak unfortunately he did not get the help that he needed he had a family to support and he ended up joining the ranks of the on average 22 veterans a day that commits suicide my question to you is how can we ensure that our military men and women understand that it's okay to get the help that they need and that they're not going to risk their careers that they are not going to be labeled how can we enforce and ensure that especially my son's generation that's that's coming into the military as careers that they didn't understand that it's okay to get the help that they need how can we change the stereotype well first of all I just want to thank you so much for sharing your story creating your organization because this is something we just have to talk about more and I honor your your your husband's service and I thank your son for his service I thank you for your service because you're serving along with them and you know sometimes the the weight of battle comes home and we see this all across our veteran populations two points I'd make the first is I have instructed the Joint Chiefs and up and down the chain of command that they have a responsibility to destigmatize mental health issues and issues of PTSD and help to explain to everybody in all of the units under their command that there's nothing weak about asking for help if you break your leg you're going to go to a doctor to get that leg healed if as a consequence of the extraordinary stress and pain that you are witnessing typically in a battlefield something inside you feels like it's wounded it's just like a physical injury you got to go get help and there's nothing weak about that that's strong and that is what will allow you then to continue to with your service and there shouldn't be a stigma against it

speaker i rise in strong support of HR 6130 the holocaust expropriated art recovery act this legislation will help restore artwork and heritage stolen by the Nazis during the Holocaust to the rightful owners or heirs I was proud to join chairman Goodlatte and introducing this bill and I appreciate his efforts in moving it forward in addition to their crimes of genocide and mass murder the Nazis engaged in comprehensive systematic theft of art and property mostly but not entirely from Jews all across Europe the scope of their theft was massive and the damaging effects remain with us today with victims still seeking justice in some form of compensation nearly twenty years ago in 1998 the United States brought together 44 nations to produce a set of principles a Nazi confiscated art they agreed that steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution to the outstanding claims in 2009 the United States joined 45 other nations in Prague to issue what was known as the tourism declaration which reaffirmed these principles unfortunately today 71 years after the defeat of the Nazis and the liberation of Europe many American victims are still unable to pursue their claims in court because of restrictive statutes of limitations in the States these laws generally require a claimant to bring a case within a limited number of years from when the loss occurred or should have been discovered but in many instances the information required to file a claim regarding artwork stolen by the Nazis was not brought to light until many years later forcing courts to dismiss cases before they could be judged on the merits in some cases the law would have required a claim to be brought even before World War two ended this is obviously unjust some states have attempted to make an exception to their statute of limitations to accommodate these claims but such efforts have been ruled unconstitutional as an infringement on the federal government's exclusive authority over foreign affairs federal legislation therefore is needed to bring justice to this area this bill would set a uniform six years federal statute of limitations for the claims of Nazi confiscated art from the time that the identity and location of the artwork and the ownership interest of the claimant are actually discovered it would also restore the claims of those claim cases were dismissed previously because of a state because of a statute of limitations this bill would finally ensure that the rightful owners and their decedent's can have their claims properly adjudicated I want to thank Ronald louder president of the World Jewish Congress for his determined efforts to see that this issue is resolved and chairman Goodlatte for working with me and our colleagues to bring this legislation forward while no legislation or act of contrition will ever reverse the many horrors committed by the Nazis one thing we can do is establish a fair judicial process so that some victims can achieve some small measure of justice I heard strong support for this legislation and I yield back the balance of my time

[Music] we went into a facility in the middle of a pandemic that is designed to hold no more than 250 people today there's more than 4 000 people how could president biden and kamala harris allow this to go on and not even come here and see it for themselves congressman steve scalise and other republican leaders visiting the southern border today condemning the conditions of overcrowding at migrant facilities calling on president biden to make immediate changes alex hogan is in mission texas with the latest alex hi diggin two separate tours within 12 hours one just after midnight that we joined with a border patrol and then one here along the river the rio grande which is the real border that was with the texas public safety department now this is a live drone look with our fox flight team at this part of the country now last night we went out on the border and we know just within this last month there was a staggering number of migrants that crossed 172 thousand people last month 53 000 of them were family units and 19 000 were unaccompanied kids one border agent says that it's the busiest he's ever seen it last night groups of migrants mostly strangers joined together for safety in numbers many stick along the way needing medical treatment treatment and we hear one child's cry off in the distance last night we ventured off to find a separate group completely lost in the brush with not one light as far as you could see now children are crossing alone agents finding kids as young as two or three years old others small children caring for ones even younger than them we see young kids eight years old in care of a five-year-old or care of a three-year-old and the older kid i mean that's the weight of the world on the kids shoulders meanwhile new now the biden administration southern border coordinator will step down at the end of the month according to reports that is roberta jacobson now today delegates also stepped onto a boat behind me to venture off into the rio grande river while it's just about the width of a football field the trip across is not a safe one we are told by agents and other officials that people drown they also capsize and also the current takes them away last month in march we saw a 71 percent increase from february of the number of crossings meanwhile many children are caught in the crossroads of this political problem deagon alex thank you so much for that alex hogan in texas joining me now is chad wall former acting department of homeland security secretary a heritage foundation visiting fellow chad great to see you this has been going on for weeks has this administration the biden administration done one tangible thing to stop this to stop this child abuse well i think it's very difficult to point to to one thing obviously they rolled back a number of policies and initiatives that we had put in place to stem this type of crisis we saw similar numbers in 2019 but we put in a number of measures in place and of course the biden administration rolled those back without putting anything uh up to stop the number of individuals illegally crossing and so you're going to continue to see these numbers not only in the month of march but obviously april may and june as this continues and again i i keep saying it they continue to treat this as though it's a capacity issue and a crisis they continue to build more facilities which is going to encourage more and more individuals to come so until they get serious about actually enforcing the laws on our border holding accountable those individuals that are breaking the law and making it clear that it's not okay to send your minor your child or a family unit across that border if that's not going to change or they're not going to put policies in place to effectuate that change then we're going to continue to see these numbers month after month i'll give the people in the byte administration the benefit of the doubt no one is this incompetent that they don't want the bad press obviously but they do want open borders de facto open borders nancy pelosi said the other day said a couple days ago the fact is that we're on a good path at the border under the leadership of president biden she's telling the truth if you want open borders and want uh illegal immigrants flooding into the united states i think this is the result of uh you know folks in the biden administration who don't believe in immigration law don't believe in immigration enforcement uh and start talking about amnesty bills and we've seen two amnesty bills passed in the house of representatives and so when you have a thought process and those are your policy objectives at the end of the day you're going to continue to see this type of surge because folks south of the border that want to come to the u.s are watching these developments they understand if they get to the border they're not going to be turned around and they understand if they stay here long enough perhaps they too will get amnesty and again it's very very dangerous it's a very inhumane policy and because you are encouraging folks to take a very dangerous journey and we know that the vast majority don't apply or sorry don't qualify for asylum and will have to be returned to their home countries at the end of the day i want to get your reaction to this according to a reuters report an interview the byte administration is considering sending cash payments to central americans trying to convince them from making the trek into the united states trying to cross into the u.s potentially sending money and we're spending what how many millions of dollars on facility 60 million a week to house migrants so cash transfers to guatemala honduras and el salvador this is uh based on an interview with roberta jacobson she's the southern border coordinator who is planning to leave that position but let's send cash to these nations and people so they don't come into the u.s not only is that absurd it simply won't work there's nothing to stop an individual unless you fix what's going on at the border today there is going to be nothing that stops them from taking money doing whatever they can to get to that border because they know if they get there they will be released in the united states that is their goal we know that the vast majority of these folks are economic migrants they're looking for jobs or they're looking to be reunited with their family and you and if they know if they get to the border then the biden administration has signaled through messaging or their policies that they will be able to stay here and that's exactly the wrong message that we want to send we want to make sure that folks have uh access to the asylum system if they're really being persecuted but we know 90 of them are not and we need to enforce the laws that we have and we don't need to send money elsewhere we need to do the job the biden administration has a playbook for how this should work we gave it to them we briefed them on it and we told them the consequences of what would happen if they took that down and unfortunately we're seeing the result of that when you brief them what was their reaction in your fa like how did they react so they were mainly in receive mode you got to remember this is before inauguration day so this is back in december and january so they're in receive mode uh and they're understanding what we're saying they're not offering up a lot of uh information about policies that they would undertake shortly after january 20th so in some respects you know our job was trying to read them trying to understand what they would do and then trying to explain to them if they did take certain actions this is what was going to happen but over a dozen different briefings given to them by cbp and ice and other elements of the immigration components at dhs so they had a full picture of what they were faced with of the limitations in border patrol stations hhs facilities and how that was going to work in a coveted environment and for whatever reason they decided to ignore that and and move forward and unfortunately we are now seeing numbers the highest we've ever seen in 20 years and in some cases for minors the highest we've ever seen ever since we've started keeping stats and it's only going to get worse i called it child abuse at the start of the segment and i certainly i think anybody would question how much receiving was going on from those those biden officials as you were briefing them chad wolfe great to see you thank you so much have a good weekend all right thank you

Speaker Boehner releasing this video blaming the President and Senate Democrats for the jobs number pointing to a stack of jobs bills passed by the house that are sitting there on the Senate side have a look Americans are again left asking the question were the jobs it's clear that one way we can help is to pass the transportation bill I think it was instructive to read the the jobless numbers this morning the job loss in the construction sector was the largest of them all once again if we can we have an answer to this and that is to pass the transportation bill we all have roads and bridges that are falling apart and America can't compete with this crumbling infrastructure that puts people to work in all of our districts is not a Republican Democrat deal but there's such an ideological divide within the Republican passes that mr. Boehner isn't even able to bring what he was calling a signature bill to the floor we're talking again about two million jobs on that transportation that two million jobs we've got an exclusive report here the nonprofit organization transportation for america is a new study showing we got it we got it uniquely here that the bipartisan Senate transportation but would create and save a total of three million jobs Republican House didn't pass a transportation bill yet but using the Transportation allotment in the budget bill they did pass as a guide the Republican approach but unfortunately the Republican approach to the headaches they kill a half a million jobs Americans are again left asking the question where are the jobs we're talking again about two million jobs on that transportation that two million jobs the house should stay in session we shouldn't be going on a break we shouldn't be taking a vacation until we get this important work done there are three things that have to be done one is the transportation authorization bill this is the funds to invest in our national infrastructure on transportation expire at the end of this if we can't get an agreement now the Senate has a bipartisan agreement in other words Republicans and Democrats in the Senate agreed to to move forward we've simply said to Speaker Boehner let's vote on that bill let's have a vote in the house I can't tell you how hard Senator boxer and Senator Inhofe have worked on that committee this bipartisan effort a Democrat and Republican has resulted in a compromise bill which they personally hand delivered to the speaker of the house john boehner of ohio this week they understand we have a july first deadline they understand the urgency to take it up and move it to create and keep 2.8 million jobs in America what was the response of Speaker Boehner well it was warm and welcoming but the fact is as of today maybe tomorrow the house has gone for a week so in this critical period of time when we're up against a July first deadline when millions of American jobs are on the line the House Republicans are leaving Americans are again left asking the question where are the jobs and we're talking again about two million jobs on that transportation that two million jobs we have 70,000 bridges in America that need repair and replacement not 700 not 7,000 but 70,000 and the highway bill is hung up over the house someplace they aren't focused on jobs they've been too busy checking the political scoreboard the Republicans will say they sent 30 bills over to the Senate they sent 30 pieces of message over to the Senate we don't need 30 message bills we need one good bipartisan bill and that's the transportation though

mr speaker our country has a proud history of honoring our military heroes and in doing so we place an emphasis on recognizing service members whose actions place themselves in harm's way for the benefit of our nation and their fellow soldiers it's because of this proud history i have serious concerns about the department of defense placement of the newly established distinguished warfare medal in the order of precedence surely it is appropriate to recognize service members who make contributions through technology-driven warfare however i agree with the vfw that we must continue to preserve the sanctity of our medals for those americans who sacrifice their personal safety for the safety of the country and their brothers and arms that is why i strongly support the effort led by my friend congressman duncan hunter who was a decorated veteran himself to alter the rank of the distinguished warfare medals such as it ranks below the purple heart in precedence i would encourage all of my colleagues to join me by co-sponsoring his bill h.r 833 and urge for its passage i yield back

good evening i'm chris wallace in for brett fair president obama is making major changes in the way the u.s enforces its immigration laws and those changes come as he scrambles for an election-year foothold with a major voting bloc chief white house correspondent ed henry has our top story exactly one week before president obama delivers a key speech to a major latino group in the battleground of florida his administration issued a directive allowing hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants to get work permits and stave off deportation they pledge allegiance to our flag they are americans in their heart in their minds in every single way but one on paper presumptive republican nominee mitt romney who's also speaking to the latino group agreed with the sentiment but slammed it as a half measure if i'm president we'll do our very best to have that kind of long-term solution that provides certainty and clarity for the people who come into this country through no fault of their own the president noted he has been pushing a solution with the dream act providing conditional permanent residency to immigrants in good standing but republicans blocked it today various republicans ripped the executive move as a power grab and just last year the president seemed to have reservations too the notion that i can just suspend deportations through executive order that's just not the case because there are laws on the books that congress has passed a sign for republicans this decision is more about securing votes in swing states like colorado florida nevada and new mexico i think politically pandering in an election year because he and all of us know how important the hispanic vote is homeland security secretary janet napolitano who crafted the policy told fox politics was not involved it was the product of really looking at what the results were of the re the ongoing review of pending cases how we want to focus our resources for now and for the next for the coming year it affects about eight hundred thousand people who can apply for a two-year deferred action they have to be under 30 and arrived here before they turn 16 no criminal record earned a high school diploma and continuing their education or serving in the military a reporter from the conservative daily caller rankled the president by interrupting his statement the answer to your question sir and the next time i prefer you let me finish my statements before you ask that question is this is the right thing to do for the american people now the general question was legitimate what's the impact on unemployment from giving illegal immigrants workers permission when you've already got millions of americans out of work right now typically though reporters wait until the president is finished making his statement out of respect for the office before shouting the question chris i gotta say i never saw it before ed henry reporting for the white house ed thank you

south carolina congresswoman nancy mace sits on the house oversight committee and joins us now congresswoman may see when 123 of your republican colleagues sent this letter to the speaker of the house nancy pelosi you can see that i've marked this up here because there's a lot in it one of the things you say is that you are writing to quote express our outrage at the activities that you have undertaken as speaker in the manner of congresswoman marionette miller meeks she won in a certified election by six votes and now the speaker is considering unseating her what do you say i say that nancy pelosi's hypocrisy knows no bounds um what we're seeing today you see rita hart trying to get d.c politicians to elect her because the iowa voters just didn't and you know the hypocrisy here you see nancy pelosi saying that there there's no voter fraud that exists yet there was voter fraud so we've got to overturn the results of this election and i hate politics i'm in politics because i hate it i hate it because of hypocrisy and that's what we're seeing today right so so what she is doing is is the heart complete they went through the whole process uh marionette miller meeks was certified the winner was very very close six votes but hart is claiming there were 22 votes that were not counted she did not go to court about this instead she went to the house 107 times since 1933 that has happened but only three times it's been overturned and only once since 1969 so this is some pretty significant action that the speaker is considering here significant and unprecedented when you talk about a legally certified election the votes in marionette miller meek's race were counted recounted and then some instances were recounted for a third time again and so as you mentioned reader heart didn't go through the court system that would be the place to adjudicate any potent propensity or any potential voter fraud she refused to do that she went straight to dc to the democrats in d.c to overturn a legally certified election and if we're going to have um voting system standards we've got to have it across the board it shouldn't be well nancy plose is in power and she wants to have more power this is a power grab by nancy pelosi and dc democrats yeah to that to that point in the letter that you and your colleagues sent to nancy pelosi you wrote quote this is not about what the american people want this is about what you want now there are even some democrats who are warning look you know you might get the short-term victory here you might pick up a seat but you could have some real problems in november if people get ticked off by what you they see here right and i can tell you the american people hate hypocrisy just like you and i do and it's not just this hypocrisy on this particular election i think we're going to have a lot to talk about in two years right next uh you know the biden administration is going to raise taxes on hard-working american people i think we're going to have a lot to work with in two years and this is this is troublesome there have been several democrats too who've spoken out against overturning the results of a legally certified election in iowa you had congressman pappas out of new hampshire being one of those and he's not the only one yeah congresswoman nancy mason's always good to get your take on thanks thanks for joining us today appreciate it thank you

thank you mr chairman thank you gentlemen for your time here this morning with us uh i along with a number of other folks last week got a sat in on a briefing on the final report from the national security commission on artificial intelligence i'm not sure if you all had a chance to see that fascinating 750 page report so it's not like bedtime reading but a lot of great recommendations in there and one of the key uh findings that they they landed on was the need for us to establish ai readiness by 2025 a closing window we've got a an advantage but our adversaries are closing that rapidly and they feel that we need to make some significant investment in those areas i know that we have as an intelligence community with with things like project maven and mars i know we're working to uh to capitalize on artificial intelligence and machine learning you know one of the findings they said was the intelligence community will benefit from ai more than any other national security mission but then further we've talked a little bit about talent they said the talent deficit in dod and the intelligence community represents the greatest impediment to our achieving that ai readiness by 2025. uh general barry i i was really intrigued with your recommendation there about the service academy candidates because i feel the same way every year we have a tremendous talent pool there and in all these hearings and even across departments with other uh agencies in the government it's just this need for talent that we're all fighting and particularly in the area of the digital world we talked a little bit about um um uh digital service academy uh and other meetings i'd be curious for y'all's thoughts on whether you think there's maybe maybe there's a time for a new service academy a digital service academy would you support that what are your thoughts representative franklin um i'll just start and quickly turn to my colleagues ai ml it's going to be a game changer already is a game changer and it's it's an area where our adversaries are they really understand it uh they understand that data is power and being able to harness that data is really where your power will be in the future and so getting after this as you know in the uh usdins we we have the project major is something that we we we prototyped if you will and now ensuring that we can get that out so that we can uh actually spread that throughout the uh the intelligence enterprise is going to be key so we're focused on this um haven't thought about the digital academy piece know that we need to have a better way of actually coalescing around this but um your your comment is is spot on where we need to be and i know my colleagues have been thinking about so let me pass it to uh generals uh barrier and nakazoni for their comments congressman that's a that's a great comment about um ai and that's everything for di right now as we as we move from the legacy database called midb think of it as uh everything we know about the world but in analog think of excel spreadsheets think of stubby pencils think about analyst time on a target folder if you will two an automated ai ml infused product that is much richer um in this day and age and will will be a foundation for the department as we move into our joint warfighting concept so it is everything to us and and we would like to invite you and your other community members down to take a look at that on on the uh on the digital academy i i would just say that we need folks who are data literate and and and understand uh the science because right right now they're hard to find um if it took a digital academy that would be an interesting way to put a bunch of those folks into the workforce uh very very rapidly and it's a it's a very intriguing idea but i've had the opportunity to take the outbrief on the national commission in fact they out briefed me just this week i couldn't agree more with you with regards to the talent piece of it we have a tremendous amount of talent here at the national security agency with regards to ai and ml and data science what i would tell you is is that it's not necessarily always the recruitment piece that is the critical element of it it's the ability to ensure that someone that comes into the national security agency on day one doesn't leave us in five years or six years it's the ability to grow that person in a series of different uh jobs uh at the same time you know being able to understand that that person is being recruited by the best of private industry and government and i think this really does speak to um what secretary moultrie i know is very interested in taking on which which is a look at how do we ensure our best talent stays within the defense intelligence establishment and that's something that we're going to have to do collectively okay yeah they have cited specifically 2025 as a as a kind of a marker out there for when we need to be ready uh do you all feel that we are making the proper investments to to maintain the advantage we have over our near peer adversaries and if not what do we need to do to ensure that we keep that advantage uh i'll i'll start uh representative franklin um i think we're folk we we understand what the priorities are in this space and we understand the things that we need to do and so we are we're going to allow ourselves to ensure that we we maintain that that advantage i call the decision advantage some people call it an information advantage we have to have the tactical military advantages too but we know where where we need to invest to to actually get better and more agile and more capable we'll get there we just need to make sure that we have the uh the interaction collaboration across the interagency and across the ic uh with dni to do that let me pass it to my colleagues for their comments congressman i would say that for forget ahead sir okay mr uh lieutenant general barry yeah if you can make a quick uh summary summary yes chairman so so for for dia um investment in this space is critical for so i would say this is the number one tie between mars and the ai and ml programs that we have there along with jaywick's it in the in the top secret the top secret network run for the department

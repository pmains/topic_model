it's now my pleasure to recognize a member for her inquiry thanks again mr. chairman I'd like to submit for the record a March 2020 report from the National Center on early childhood quality titled addressing the decreasing number of family childcare providers in the United States without objection thank you again to all of our witnesses for sharing your experiences here today I have a couple of questions for secretary Sullivan in your testimony you said Indiana deemed a child care and essential service and was able to keep some providers open to serve essential workers the state receive any waivers or additional flexibility from the administration or HHS to help make sure providers can still operate thank you for the question we have been so lucky with the flexibility that comes with a child catcher Block Grant and utilized all of those flexibilities to make sure that we were able to allow children to continue to access childcare services as you heard early in the test of my testimony we went virtual very early as an agency and made sure that there was ongoing eligibility assessment that was uninterrupted despite the response we created an additional status for essential workers our current three priority statuses pre-pandemic were our in partnership with our Department of Child Services for foster families for caregivers that participate in the program and for caregivers that participate in the SNAP program and so this created another eligibility category that allowed those essential workers to access or access and immediately enter CCDF we also granted a great degree of flexibility for families to take increased personal days so that it's actively working they would still be able to keep their vouchers so that when they did go back to work they wouldn't have a gap in services additionally we didn't ask families we asked child care providers to be eligible for temporary assistance grants to not charge families to hold spots so that was a preexisting repairment to be eligible for the grant so that families wouldn't pay for child care that they weren't using and having an additional financial burden on those families please so every camel is unique so it's important to make sure we preserve different childcare options for parents can you count how the state has work to include family childcare in quality improvement initiatives and other efforts to support access for families this is a really interesting question we know nationally that the number of family child Care's are dropping and in some states it's actually dropped by as much as 20 percent five years we've been asked to look at this on multiple occasions and in Indiana that actually is not the case we continue to see a stable number of child care homes as part of the services that are provided in Indiana and we the one of the conclusions that we've drawn from that is that we don't include many states don't include family homes in their quality rating and improvement system and also don't allow them to participate in their pre-k programs and we and don't fund them the same as they would for a center how we do so we include our child care network in its sum total we include that they're able to participate in our on my way pre-k program and also are part of our paths to quality initiative so they can be designated on that level of high quality childcare and be ranked in that space and so we we thought that we have a best practice here to make sure again that we really support on that work there's we have a long way to go but we've made sufficient really substantial progress over the last five years of enhancing those services and and providing supplemental technical assistance for the entire spectrum of providers and then what can we do at the federal level to support and grow family child care providers so they're both high quality early learning settings for children and they're sustainable businesses as well what can what's the best thing we could do to help we need to start thinking about child care the way that we think about these sustainable Network this has to be something that can last for more than two weeks at a time one of our our biggest points of learning is that the assistance that we need to develop this as a not just a safe place for kids to go but a place for them to learn to be healthy and then to be a business is really our goal and so establishing child care and not daycare but really early childhood education and the maturity that comes along with a networked system that has sustainable funding that's flexible that can respond to pandemics and not just natural disasters is really that's really a short-term goal it shouldn't be in the in the distant future for us I so much appreciate your testimony thanks so much mr. chairman I yield back thank you Thank You representative Markey and now it's my

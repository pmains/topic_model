thank you very much mr. president mr. president last week a man submitted his two weeks notice in Virginia Beach at his place of employment before going there and shooting 12 people and injuring 4 others he unloaded dozens of rounds indiscriminately in addition to two handguns he had extended ammunition magazines and a suppressor to muffle the sound of gunfire this was the hundredth mass shooting in America coming on the hundredth day of the year this has become a regular part of life in the United States of America individuals walking into churches and shopping malls and schools and places of employment and shooting indiscriminately such that dozens of innocent lives are lost in most cases the same kinds of weapons are used semi-automatic rifles extended magazines weapons or components of weapons that are banned in other countries were banned in this country for a period of time because they are believed to be so dangerous such that they should be in the exclusive province of the military and law enforcement Ryan Keith Cox was 50 years old when he was shot and killed on May 31st he was known for his soft-spoken nature and his powerful singing voice in his church choir and he was constantly affecting those around him with small but meaningful gestures of kindness the day that he was killed in Virginia Beach a close coworker of Ryan's Christy Dewar was with him when the shooting started and Ryan told Christie and other colleagues to barricade themselves in the break room Christie implored Keith to join them in the break room and he said to her I have to go check on the other ones Keith left and he was soon shot by the gunman as he was assisting other co-workers to safety Christie said every time that I was upset Ryan would give me a big hug when I was upset about something he knew exactly what to say to make you smile he's the type of person who you know would lay down his life for someone just like he did bishop Williams of faith world ministries in Norfolk said that he had known Keith and his family for years they were close they were very a very loving family they've just been leaders in our church world Bishop Williams said Ryan Keith Cox was 50 years old when he was shot in Virginia Beach Joshua Hardy was two years older he was 52 years old he is had been working for four and a half years as an engineering technician at the city of Virginia Beach he was raised in Hampton Roads it came from a really big family and he was described by his friends and his family is being incredibly caring especially about kids he didn't have any children of his own but he often watched over his nieces and nephews one of his nieces Tasha remembered that he was around a lot and he cared for me and all my cousins she said he was like a father figure to me because my dad wasn't around in 2011 Josh actually published a book called the ABC book on protecting yourself from strangers and the people he worked with remember being so impressed that Josh had gone above and beyond the call one of his colleagues in the engineering department Larry night gave a copy of the book to his daughter and his grandson he remembers Joshua just always having a smile on the job quote Joshua was one of the nicest men you would ever care to meet he was funny and kind-hearted he would do anything for you laQuita Brown was 39 years old she was a public servants from Chesapeake Virginia she worked in the Public Works Department for more than four years she was a right-of-way agent her friends called her ms worldwide because she loved to travel she had been all around the world and her social media was plastered with pictures of her travels her father as any father would be is absolutely heartbroken by her death he said she was just everything she was everything to me I know nobody's perfect but from the time she was born she had no faults for the brown family the grief surrounding laQuita death comes on the heels of Liquide his brother dying from a hit-and-run driver three years ago her father says that will laQuita helped him through the grief she saved me he said I wouldn't have made it through that without her a hundred days into the year a hundred mass shootings doesn't happen anywhere else in the world except for the United States of America we can't claim to be helpless we can't claim to have no solutions because if it only happens here and nowhere else then there must be something different happening here right we can learn we can adapt we are now a hundred days since the House of Representatives passed a universal background checks bill a universal background checks bill that is supported by 90% of Americans and would have a significant downward effect on the number of people that are shot in this country now we tend to only pay attention as a nation as and as a body when something like Virginia Beach happens when there is a mass shooting of epic scale when when 5 or 10 or 20 people lose their life at one time but since the House passed the universal background checks bill 10,000 people have been shot and killed in America that's a stunning number 10,000 people have been shot and killed in America in just the hundred days since the House passed the universal background checks bill and the vast majority of these individuals are not are not killed in mass shootings most of these are suicides most of these are individuals who who took their own life with a weapon others are accidental shootings many of them are homicides and and the grief and the pain that comes with all of those is no different than the grief that laQuita Brown's family is feeling right now we should care about every single one of these deaths and the reason why I peg this to the passage of the background checks bill is because what we know is that background checks saves lives in states that have universal background checks meaning you know if you're getting a gun in a commercial sale you need to prove that you're not a criminal you're not seriously mentally ill and in states that have universal background checks you have less suicides you have less homicides Connecticut is a perfect example research shows that once we passed our universal background checks requirement we did it quite a number of years ago we saw a 40% reduction in gun homicides in our state similarly when Missouri went from having a universal background checks requirement and not having one they saw a 40% increase in gun homicides in their state and so not every single one of these 10,000 deaths is preventible but many of them are it's not that we don't know what to do it's not that we don't know what makes this country different it's just that we're unwilling to take those steps just this past weekend 52 people were shot in communities across this country 10 deaths from gunshot wounds in Chicago alone and these victims are just as worth remembering as the victims in Virginia Beach or Sandy Hook or parkland Dwane Brown was 16 years old he was a sophomore in high school in Chicago Illinois and he was all hyped up to throw himself the biggest 16th birthday party that his friends had ever seen at the end of April he was gonna throw down but in April first he was standing in front of a gas station when a gunman opened fire hitting Dwayne in the leg and the chest one of his basketball teammates thought the initial news of graignes death was an April Fool's joke it happened on April 1st and so when he heard about it he just went back to sleep his friends said Dwayne was the life of the party he was so energetic I was with him a week ago and for this to happen in that time period I'm just in shock at a vigil his elementary school principal read an excerpt of something he had written well in school Wayne wrote I want to be a good son always be there for my mom and always be there to take care of her a couple weeks ago Jalen Elzey was a freshman at finger Academy High School in Chicago according to his uncle Jacob was an outgoing kind hearted kid he lived with his mother he had two sisters and three brothers Jalen's not around anymore because he was one of those victims of gun violence in the city of Chicago his uncle said this summer in the city it's just something different other kids look forward to going to summer camp Jalen was just trying to make sure he lived another day his uncle Jacob began tearing up as he recalled his favorite memory of Jalen as a small child whenever Jalen and his brother would come stay with their uncle they'd take a bath and then they'd nestled amongst the pillows in the blankets waiting for their uncle to blast them with hot air from a blow dryer he was just a lovable kid surviving his environment said his uncle and he knew about family family was always instilled in him mr. president since my life was changed in December of 2012 when 20 first-graders were killed in Sandy Hook I've tried to come down to the floor of the House of Representatives every couple weeks and tell the stories of victims of gun violence in this country to try to put some some personality behind the 10 thousand lives that have been lost in the last 100 days and I told you about five of the victims this morning but our inaction is complicity now there are tough things and then there are easy things I get it that there are some anti-gun violence measures that I would support that are that are just too hot for some Republican members but I don't care what state you're from 97% of your constituents 80% of your constituents the vast majority of your constituents support expanding background checks to make sure that if you buy a gun online or you buy a gun at a gun show you got to go through a five minute background check all of our constituents no matter whether we represent a blue state or a red state support extreme risk protection holders the idea that you should be able to go to court when somebody is on the verge of lashing out against someone else or gonna hurt themselves and take away their guns at least temporarily these are things that are not controversial anywhere except for here that we could pass since the House passed the background checks bill by the way with bipartisan support 10,000 people have died but there have been a hundred and nine mass shootings thirty-one states have had a mass shooting 166 kids have been killed or injured 775 teenagers have been killed or injured and so I'm here on the floor today to send my heartfelt condolences to the families in Virginia Beach who continue to mourn yet another mass shooting I expressed as I always do my condolences to the families of gun violence throughout this country 80 to 90 people lose their life every day from a gunshot wound but I'm also here today to ask my colleagues to think about why we continue to refuse to have a debate on a piece of legislation that the House passed a hundred days ago in a bipartisan fashion even if you don't love the version of the background checks bill that the House passed bring your own version to the floor bring a different bill that will address the epidemic of gun violence in this country all I ask is that you don't do nothing that you stopped your absolute silence in the face of this epidemic of slaughter let the Senate be the Senate I heard that there was a time some years ago when the United States Senate actually debated legislation I've read in the history books that this is supposedly the greatest deliberative body in the world we are do no deliberation here bill after bill passes the House of Representatives none of it comes before the Senate for a vote no health care bills no immigration bills no anti gun violence bills I get it that this bills that passed the house probably can't pass a republican-led Senate but why are we not even trying who is in charge here the special interests who want nothing to happen the gun lobby the health insurance companies or are we in charge we're the ones that got elected we're the members of the United States Senate we could choose to have these debates hash out our differences and see if there is a proposal that 60 of us could agree on that would do something about this unacceptable level of gun violence that plagues this nation on a daily basis I yield the floor

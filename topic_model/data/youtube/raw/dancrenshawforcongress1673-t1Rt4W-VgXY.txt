on here with reaction to this and president Trump's national security speech earlier this week retired lieutenant commander Dan Crenshaw who was a Navy SEAL for ten years along with middle-east journalists and founding editor of foreign desk News terror analysts as well Lisa Daktari thank you both so much for being here tonight thank you for having me Lisa I want to start with you this bombshell report shows that the Obama administration allegedly stopped the D from continuing prosecutions of Hezbollah agents operating inside the United States and South America what does this say about the Obama administration's foreign policy and how does it make the Trump administration isolation of Iran harder yeah you know diplomacy is a wonderful thing warming of ties with the nation that we've not had diplomatic ties with for over four decades is even more beautiful thing particularly if it means economic or national security gain for the United States but it's an awful thing when it means selling out the American people and the Iranian people when you look at this deal and we talked about this before because analysts like myself and many others were very critical of it because at every turn there were these inconvenient truths facts that showed us that the Iranian regime was not looking to curb its activities whether it was at home with its human rights records or in the region reaching its tentacles into Iraq and Syria and Yemen undermining US national security and our foreign policy plants and now when you add to this all these different layers Hezbollah which is a direct tentacle of the Iranian regime supported by them since 1980 you see that this was yet another national security issue or you can look at it more as a domestic issue here with our drug problem in this country and it was completely overlooked in in the light of pushing forward this deal right and Hezbollah is not a ragtag team of terrorists who were hiding in caves they're very sophisticated global organization that was responsible for more American murders pre 9/11 than any other terrorist organization Dan I want to speak to you specifically about that issue you served in Iraq and Afghanistan a lot of this money that they were using that they were funneling through drug cartels and working with the Venezuelans was used for weapons to kill American troops for your reaction to that that's absolutely correct and not only if I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan I've been on the ground in Lebanon and Beirut I've seen firsthand what Hezbollah do and their capabilities the threats that they pose to us or Lebanese partners or Israeli allies that they're a global threat and as you said they're they're sophisticated they're counterintelligence capabilities are high we need to be worried about things these things not not giving them handouts for some miscalculated foreign policy achievement mm-hmm we said that the Obama administration and the officials who worked on the Iran deal Ben Rhodes in particular has fought back against this this this story without actually citing any facts about what's wrong and anything that's in the story that's inaccurate moving forward how does the Trump administration carry out the president's national security strategy in isolating Iran as the problem with the Saudis the Egyptians in the Middle East with this you know years long investigation that was hampered it seems like they have a lot of catching up to do a lot it's very tough to turn back eight years of this apologist foreign policy that put everyone else first in America last now the president Trump is attempting to put America first and it's very ironic how he gets pushed back you know from Americans first of all when you have the pushback from Americans who say that we shouldn't cut foreign aid over for example the UN Jerusalem vote or that we shouldn't deliver it a slap on the wrist to Pakistan or any other nation getting these free handouts from the United States this is not money that came from Donald Trump's piggy bank this is taxpayer money so left right and center this affects all of us and when you have you know president Trump standing at the podium on Monday and delivering what I thought was a very strong and centrist foreign policy strategy that puts us first it talks about economic strength it talks about political strength it talks about peace through strength and I think that's a wonderful thing that all Americans should agree on dan the Trump administration laid out four pillars based on your experience what is different about the Trump administration's approach to national security come to the Obama administration moving forward well there's a lot of things to like here there's a huge focus on border security that is extremely important to us in Texas we are on the front lines I've been on the front lines in a lot of places but as says Texas we're on the front lines of border security here I also like that he focuses on economic security and in identifying economics as a national as a pillar of national security that's extremely important and we just got a huge win this week with the tax reform bill that's gonna be a big part of that making America competitive all around the world I mean that's part of national security border security national security and and he's also rebuilding the military I've seen morale dip over the years and I've seen it especially the Special Operations community morale is picking up under this president that's because he's unleashing the capabilities that we have we're taking the fight to the enemy people know where we stand in this world now this national security document is about clarity and it's great and there's a lot of wins this week you know Haley in the UN really I mean it's great when Lisa one of the speaking of taking the fight to the enemy the one of the most undercover stories of the year is the wins against Isis in Iraq in Syria that has been underreported to a significant extent but that doesn't mean that the FBI isn't busy here at home with a thousand plus cases open in every single state so how does the administration move forward domestically in fighting jihadism here at home I think there is a strong focus on the reality of the situation that has been ignored for many years meaning we've always said if we can win the ground battle against Isis overnight which we could and we actually did it wasn't overnight but it was fairly quickly under the trump foreign policy there is then this fixation on you can't feed Isis just on the ground battle but because they've spread so so perversely throughout the internet and on the web on the dark web that you know a lot of us are still covering and looking at how they sprout up on all different types of social media platforms chat putting out all types of media but I think the the Trump administration understands that fight the fact that it this kind of the low-hanging fruit meaning the easy recruits that are sought after whether it's on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook etc to fight that message and it's a very very daunting task but I think a lot of that about our resources are being put on the local fight kind of on the local fight and also on the social media cyber security etc dan quick last word do you know I agree with everything Lisa said it's extremely important to take the fight home here work with our local law enforcement defeat radicalization here at home those are the kind of attacks we're gonna see a lot of in the future that aren't necessarily being complicated attacks like 9/11 but those lone wolf attacks that come from a lot of radicalization right well we'll see how it we do it moving forward the new years right around the corner commander Dan Crenshaw Lisa deft Ari thanks so much the judge

the meantime i'm very happy to be joined by rand paul and kelly paul they know a thing or two about some of the violence that we have seen at some rallies particularly this latest rally on behalf of the president and let the count go on in washington that by night time it turned into something that probably looked eerily familiar to them uh senator and mrs paul thank you for joining us i hope you're doing okay uh you know when you saw what was going on in washington over the weekend it did look eerily familiar what you encountered leaving the white house after the uh the big event and the president's speech there where you just were knee-deep in protesters it got pretty scary did this seem similar to that senator yeah absolutely you know i think it seems very similar but i guess what's even more disturbing is that you have both right and left calling the other side fake news many of us say well you know associated press certainly that's objective news but the ap reported this story yesterday and i wrote the i read the associated press story i had no idea who was attacking who and for what reason they wouldn't describe that these were people attacking trump uh people there supporting the president they just made it sound like oh it was just random violence caused by the trump uh protest you know by the trump uh you know rally this is the same thing that happened to us when we were there and kelly can recount it well the way the ap reported our story was uh abominable and just completely biased what i noticed mrs paul on that to your husband's point was how protesters with divergent views those pro trump let the count go on those protesting what they were talking about were actually mingling with one another they were in the same space that was exactly what you had encountered uh with a lot more of the protesters you know opposed to donald trump opposed to republicans and conservatives so it's happened again yes i think what's important to realize and there are a multitude of videos on the internet of this happening just to innocent ordinary people these folks are not agitating after you know after the rally they were in restaurants they were walking back to their hotels and they were being mobbed and assaulted by crowds of antifa and black lives matter shouting horrible things at them the same thing that they were doing to us and again these aren't folks that were trying to agitate or do anything they were trying to get back to their hotels uh what caused me to tweet out at the ap was the scene of that young girl and her parents her big brother had his arm around her she's like 10 or 11 years old she's in tears and she's being screamed at horrible stuff by grown men with megaphones and the whole family looked absolutely terrorized and i know exactly what that felt like and it just it broke my heart looking at that and then i saw people sitting in restaurants and a black lives matter supporter threw a commercial-grade firecracker at them i mean what's it gonna take for the mainstream media to really report on this is somebody gonna have to get horribly burned or assaulted um it's it's just outrageous these these thugs are just roaming the streets and just accosting people who are doing nothing more than trying to get back to their hotels this seemed to accelerate as soon as it turned to night i guess and uh senator one of the things we learned the department of homeland security had warned of violence on both sides and concerns that earlier on this is before this latest dustup this past weekend that white supremacists were the most persistent threat to our homeland but that's not so it's not just white supremacists i mean there are these antifa and other groups that uh you know have anarchy on mind so if there's such a thing as spreading the blame here there's enough to spread around well here's the thing if you read the associated press story from last night you can't tell who the people are that are arrested everybody arrested were the people attacking the trump supporters there was a mother with her child in a stroller being attacked these were the anti-trump people creating the violence entirely and yet you read ap and it doesn't even describe who these people are they say the trump demonstrations led to violence do you know when the mob attacked us and they nearly toppled a policeman and i helped to stabilize him the ap reported that oh the policeman was jostled that's not the truth whatever happened to the associated press which was supposed to be an objective beacon of truth so we complain that there's right left in our country but what if the center what if those who say they are objective are no longer objective where will people find their news you know mrs paul one of the things i did notice we touched on in the beginning with your husband as well this notion that the the the protesters of extreme views can be in the same place at the same time there's got to be a way to avoid that passions run deep they turn violent um there's got to be a way of separating crowds when this sort of happens because it's happened enough here and and i think it's fair to say in looking at this that those who were marching on behalf of donald trump and letting the count go on uh were being very very well behaved and then those of course when it turned nightfall much as we've seen in other incidents erupted into violence but that they were seen together much as when you guys came out of the white house at the time of the r c convention when the president wrapped up remarks they had sort of intermingled and were on top of each other unfortunately for you um the the guys who didn't share your views were in the overwhelming majority there's got to be a better way to handle this what do you think well i think one of the things when you look at it go ahead go ahead kelly well i think that that one of the big problems and i put this on you know mayor bowser in dc i love dc and what happened to us and what is happening to that city is that they are actually blocking off streets and these folks that were attacked neil you know going to their hotels were just like us they weren't actively demonstrating or doing anything they were just trying to get home to get to their cars to sit in restaurants and these groups are now coming after anybody that they perceive is a trump trump supporter and it it bothers me so much that antifa which is a group that professes to be anti-fascism but basically they want to terrorize bully intimidate and shout down anyone who disagrees with them and that is the definition and the essence of fascism itself and they don't care if as i said you're a young family with kids i saw an elderly lady trying to get to her uh her hotel and she had an american flag and they're ripping it out of her hands and getting up in her face and flipping her off these people are thugs and they need to be denounced and there need to be more police out in dc protecting people who want to eat in restaurants and stay in hotels and come and enjoy dc whether they're for a protest or not i have to say the last time i was in d.c i was getting ready to go for a run and i was afraid i grabbed a t-shirt out of my drawer and i was afraid to put it on because it had an american flag on it just a simple american flag but i was afraid to wear it in dc today incredible you know senator um i do remember vividly watching the video of you and your wife leaving at the time there were no police around i mean that was a couple guys was trying to help you out but they were overwhelmed here there were plenty of police around but it seemed like they were caught off guard by this and overwhelmed by this what do you do well you said how do we separate the peaceful from the non-peaceful i think that's actually pretty easy there have been many peaceful trump demonstrations and there have been some peaceful uh demonstrations for racial justice there have been i won't say there haven't been but as soon as they become not peaceful arrest the people and put them in jail one of the people that assaulted my wife and i bloodied a police officer he required stitches but you know what the dc judicial system did they released him on his own recognizance the thing is there are violent people in these mobs they have to be arrested every time and they have to be punished and it's not very hard to separate out violent from non-violent and peaceful protests can go on but when they're not peaceful you've got to arrest people but like in portland they just weren't arresting anybody so it gets worse arrest them and put them in jail if they're committing a crime you know we still have this on the resolved election senator and mrs paul and i'm wondering senator your point um there is this recount going on in georgia that should be resolved by tomorrow night do you think that should that vote come in as it has and that that there's still a difference of 12 000 or more votes that the the president should give up the fight you know i think the recall itself is unlikely to change the vote recalls rarely change the vote what i think we need to do is examine the validity of the votes so for example usually less than one percent of people vote absentee and so it's never been much to change anything except for a very close election but now you have about a third of the vote in georgia came in by mail and we should verify it so what i've advocated for is do a random sampling of about 2 000 people from fulton county and actually ask them did you vote check on the signature check each ballot in a way is what in which you were contesting whether they're valid or not and if out of 2000 you get two or three that's not enough to overturn the election but if you do a random sample of 2000 and you find 100 bad ballots you multiply that out that is plenty to change the election but i think the best way to figure this out and the best way to give republicans assurance that it was legitimate is let's do some real random sampling not just counting the votes but actually seeing if these people actually voted and if it was them so senator do you see joe biden as the the next president states i think that we need to explore all the legal avenues come to a conclusion look this isn't new in our country in 1976 my dad lost by 200 votes out of 200 000 we found 13 people voting from the same household we found people voting from vacant lots post office boxes we found one entire precinct of 2 000 people all the same signature to be signing in and every vote was for the democrat so this happens in our country but what we have to do is you have to either prove it or not prove it and it is difficult to overturn elections that's why the best chance of stopping fraud is stopping it before it happens and i don't know that it did or didn't happen but i think the best way to know if it happened in philadelphia and in atlanta is to do a random sampling large enough that you could apply that conclusion to the whole to see if the election could have been changed mrs paul if i could end with you on this of this course you and your husband caught in that melee back in august i think it it obviously seared you and knowing how dangerous that was but it's probably indicative of the times in which we live are you confident should joe biden uh take off this on january 20th that he can calm things down that that he can kind of detach this polarization going on or is this just a sign of our times and sadly we're going to see more of it sadly we're going to see opportunities where you want to go out in the streets of washington and you're you're anxious too i i'm not confident at all because i think that if he were really trying to call for unity as he says that he is he would have called out by name the groups that were responsible for the attacks on trump supporters saturday night and he did not he's continuing to kind of buy into this whole polarization thing and i blame the media as well as rand said after we were assaulted in the most horrific and terrifying night of my life the ap claimed again that that our claim was without evidence and said that the police officer who was literally having to hold a bike out as a barricade was only jostled as if he were inadvertently bumped on a you know subway car or something instead of a violent mob that he was desperately trying to hold back and help us get into our hotel because we could not move at all as they were screaming things everyone needs to really report fairly on what is going on and i think that joe biden needs to also call out these groups by name um on that point i'd said the last question would be to you on this ball uh actually you mentioned something that i do want to raise with your husband senator um i believe joe biden's remarks said to this is there's you know people got to cool it on both sides i'm paraphrasing here they're you know everyone's got to come down both sides now no one second guess those remarks as they did the president when he said essentially the same thing what did you make of well that's been misreported since the very beginning because trump was never referring to the people that committed violence and killed someone in charlottesville he was referring to the people debating over whether statues should come down that there was a reasonable argument on both sides and that has been so misreported and see even ap and seek so-called objective sources of news misreported that so yeah we do need to be honest and i don't know if things will calm down or not i want them to i think to my colleagues in the senate i say yes let's calm down and let's actually talk when president obama was president i was civil i went to the white house when president trump became president most of the democrats would not go to the white house they hated him so much that i think many of them incited the violence and if you look at the preponderance of violence it's been anti-trump it hasn't been trump protesters you got grandma out there waving a flag and you've got thugs hitting grandma on the face with a 2x4 this is not the right committing violence this is the left committing violence to peaceful people in the streets and they need to be arrested if there's anybody on the right that's doing it arrest them too arrest anybody committing violence all right final word senator paul uh this is paul thank you both very much be safe be well i think you reminded us all that everyone's got to dial it back a lot fast a little more to this

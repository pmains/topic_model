friends to sit down across to have discussions that with people that think absolutely opposite of you that's what makes america so powerful and so special is we can be different we're a nation of immigrants we we've got people from all over the world in the country right different ideas different backgrounds some people from small cities some people big cities some people from small towns right all different races all different religions don't ever stop talking to people and interacting with people that think differently than you that's what makes us special so don't be part of the divide be part of what brings this nation back together again so i thank you again thank you to all the family and everyone online for reaching out uh appreciate the time to speak today and god bless

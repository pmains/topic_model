but working with you it's imperative we get this in order I give you mr. Pascrell you're recognized mr. secretary welcome the tax bill that was pushed through cost more than a trillion five hundred billion dollars and then we add the interest and it goes on forever money that we borrowed from the future 80% of the money we spent went to the top one percent someone said a little more than that Wells Fargo alone got a handout of 3.4 billion dollars from the US Treasury you are the secretary of the Treasury after they cheated millions of customers opened fake fake accounts overcharged veterans they got this reward but following this tax cut that we're paying their shareholders twenty two and a half billion dollars their shareholders that's a hundred and two times the amount they're putting into charity and wage increases combined at the same time mr. secretary they're closing nine hundred branches so here's my first question mr. secretary because I heard you insult a lot of big states many times let's get it straight here right from the horse's mouth you stated repeatedly last year that we needed to eliminate the state and local tax deduction because we had to get out of the business of subsidizing states who wrote that talking point for you because you seem to repeat it over and over again like a broken record and I told you last year and I'll say it again New Jersey subsidizes low states that's baloney with my state getting back at 74 percent 74 cents on the dollar it contributes the federal revenue now with the Trump tax cuts will be contributing even more how dare you insult those states and you also said in your statement that what they need to do is cut their taxes well we all try to cut taxes but you know that bill went back to the Civil War long before the tax code he became into an existence to make sure that the local communities the county community state communities had enough money and resources that get by year after year that is a insane insult this week the director of the National Intelligence the CIA the FBI and other leading intelligence official warned that Russia might be meddling they did meddle in the 2016 election and will use a digital strategy to worsen it this year I understand the administration is working on implementing sanctions required by the bipartisan countering America's adversary's adversaries through sanctions Act bill that garnered more than four inch of all how many sanctions that the president direct you to impose thank you all time has expired a few danced and I get an answer question in writing members know that if you want yes or no answer give him time leave him time to do so mr. chair mr.

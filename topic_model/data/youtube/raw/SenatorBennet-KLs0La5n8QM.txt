thank you madam president 80 years ago this month president franklin roosevelt signed executive order 9066 two months after the bombing of pearl harbor and it led to some of the most disgraceful chapters in our nation's history the forced dispossession relocation and concentration of over 120 000 japanese americans during world war ii two-thirds of them were citizens of this country forced out of their homes and into internment camps by their own government they were our neighbors and they were parents and shopkeepers students doctors and factory workers they were americans in every sense of the word but racist fear forced them into these camps crowded squalid and at war with everything that we stand for as a nation one of those camps was a machi in colorado where nearly 10 000 japanese americans were detained against their will this is a photo of that camp madam president i'll mention just because i i looked it up i i figured this might be true because we've got centers from nevada and texas here there were five such places in texas as well internment camps but this is one that was in south eastern colorado and these children are among the first arrivals at amachi and they they were forced to build the camp where their own families were in turn for the duration of the war i i can't tell exactly the ages of the children in this photo madam president but i would be surprised if the pages on this floor are any older than them you know and i'd say to the president in front of the pages to ask them to imagine a time when our country interred people the age of the people that are pages on the floor of the united states senate i've had the opportunity to visit omachi a few years ago with john hopper who's a high school teacher a principal out there near the camp who along with his students created the amachi preservation society there wasn't anybody else to do it it was just a high school teacher and and his students they recognized how this how much this site meant to colorado how much this site meant to the country and acting completely on their own they worked year after year after year to restore the site so that the next generation of coloradans and americans the young people sitting on this floor today would have the opportunity to learn about what happened here if we're up to me madam president every student in colorado and throughout the american west and for that matter in our entire country would come to this site and learn about the americans of amachi the men and women who held onto hope year after year who supported one another who forged a community behind the barbed wires of this site who never gave up on the united states of america even as it was in turning them on their own soil and if they did go to omachi they could learn about one of my heroes colorado's former governor ralph carr who spoke out against what was happening at a time when most politicians in the west and in this country going all the way up to our president franklin roosevelt were either not speaking out or allowing this to happen at that time many western governors opposed internment kids not just because they were unjust but out i'm sorry at that time many western governors were comfortable locking up their fellow citizens so long as they were locked up in someone else's state because there was an anti-america japanese american prejudice in the land and some coloradans in nearby communities gave way to shameful fear of their fellow citizens and objected to their presence to say the least they objected to their presence speaking to an angry crowd one day on the eastern plains let's say to my colleague from texas this is where my colleague senator cory gardner was from this part of the state of colorado governor carr said quote i am talking to all american people whether their status be white brown or black when i say that if a majority may deprive a minority of its freedom contrary to the terms of the constitution today then you as a minority may be subjected to the same ill will of the majority tomorrow he went on the japanese are protected by the same constitution that protects us an american citizen of japanese descent has the same rights as any other citizen if you harm them he said you must first harm me he went on to lose his next election i think it was to the united states senate i shudder to think what would have happened if people like governor carr hadn't been there to stand for our highest ideals as a country or if survivors and their descendants and community leaders many of whom have close connections to colorado to this day who live in colorado to this day hadn't worked for decades to preserve the site and the memory of what happened there thanks to their work we now have the opportunity to give amachi the recognition and resources it deserves that's why i introduced this bill along with my colleague senator hickenlooper to make amachi part of the national park system this would ensure amachi has the legal status and funding to preserve the site and the memory of what happened there for years to come in the house congressman ken buck and joe nagoos introduced the bill not everybody here would know that but i know senator or congressman buck would know that he and i ran against each other in 09 and 10. that was a tough tough tough election and i barely barely won i barely won but i'm proud to serve with with congressman bach in the house and congressman nagoos in the house who also have come together just like me and senator hickenlooper to uh to support this bill this site is in ken buck's district in prowess county ken won 74 of the vote there in 2020 by the way i i think i won 33 percent in 2016. so ken is outpacing me there we don't agree on a lot but we agree a hundred percent that this matters to our state and the legacy we want to pass on to the next generation i have a list of 65 groups that support this bill the asian chamber of commerce the colorado council of churches the colorado municipal league if that weren't enough the bill also has the support of the chairman and the ranking member of the environment and natural resources committee but today there's one senator out of 99 and it's not the senior senator from texas who's objecting to this bill this bill passed the house of representatives with all but two votes we have 99 senators on one side who supports this and one objecting i have absolutely no idea why that one senator is objecting and i hope that it's just a mis a misunderstanding of some kind um we fight for a lot of things on this floor but there's there is a bipartisan tradition going back to teddy roosevelt of both parties coming together to protect places that matter to our heritage as a nation amachi matters madam president to colorado and it matters to america this is about whether we're going to ignore the worst parts of our history or lift them up and give future generations the opportunity to learn from them so that we can move this country closer to our highest ideals so i hope that the senator who is objecting to this to this bipartisan bill with massive support in both the house and the senate that's of critical importance to the state of colorado that doesn't touch and concern any other state in the union except to the extent that people from those states of the union might someday like to come here and learn an important episode in our country's history i feel strongly about this in part mr president madam president because my own mom and her family were dislocated by the same war they were living on the other side of the world in poland the entire family was killed except for an aunt and my grandparents and my mom and and she she got here when she was 11 years old probably the same age as the young children here who were picked up from their homes all across the western united states and brought to a place that they never had known before and it seems to me the least we can do with this massive bipartisan support is to is to pass this bill so as if in legislative session madam president i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar number 255 h.r 2497 further the committee reported amendment be agreed to the bill as amended be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table is there an objection madam president senator from texas madam president reserving the right to object due to the winter storms that are shutting down airports around the country senator lee the senator from utah who who objects to this unanimous consent request is not here and i had the bad luck to be here when he communicated to me his desire that i make an objection on his behalf i would say to my friend from colorado i'm a non-combatant on this issue i didn't hold his bill but i know senator lee does have an amendment i believe he wants to offer and certainly he wants to be here to participate in the discussion and and vote on the bill so on his behalf i object objection is heard i thank the senator from the senior center from texas who in fact is a non-combatant uh in this effort and i i'm sorry that he's had the misfortune of having to come out here and object i will say uh madam president that colorado and utah are right next to each other and i face the same travel issues that the senator from utah faces i guess i hope i hope he gets where he's trying to go but i stayed here this evening because not because i objected to this but because i thought it was so incredibly important for us to get this work done and and i want the the record to reflect that i actually didn't name the senator who objected but the senator from texas did my fervent hope is that we can work this out because really importantly we are having a the anniversary of franklin roosevelt's decision to inter these young people um this month and if we don't get this back to the house of representatives um we may miss that anniversary and people in colorado would miss the chance to be able to uh demonstrate that they have that they're carrying this really important legacy forward you know and i think about my my mom's experience experiences here the country these young men and women are growing up and who are with us today it just makes me think even more how important all of this is and and madam president i can't think of anybody i would rather have had this discussion with than with you sitting in this chair it's

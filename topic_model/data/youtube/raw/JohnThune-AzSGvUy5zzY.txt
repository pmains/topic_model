to minority whip John thune on how that vote is shaping up in the Senate Senator thank you very much for joining us so where do things stand at this hour well it's not real clear Sandra the the house has acted so the legislation is headed toward the Senate um the Democrats in the Senate attempted to hotline a bill in other words to expedite its consideration that has been objected to and we'll see now as negotiations get underway about what the path forward might be in the Senate but what I can tell you is there's a lot of consternation among Republicans in the Senate that we're in this position in the first place Republicans don't believe that this is a role for congress this is something that should have been worked out negotiated and and that the administration the president prior to the election who punted this until after the election is now trying to get members of Congress to bail him and his administration out for their failure to get this deal done so there's a lot of conversations still to be held and how this ultimately gets disposed of in the Senate I think is still an open question Senator where do you stand on things some of your colleagues have indicated that they will not support what they see as a deal for the union bosses rather than the railroad railroad workers themselves so are you in favor of it well I I don't want to see a rail strike a shutdown for sure but the one thing I will say and this is something that's a lot of our members are discussing is the possibility that a one option here would be to extend the cooling off period for 30 days or 60 days or whatever that term would be to force the parties back to the table to get a deal that everybody could sign off on so that Congress isn't forced to be put in a position I don't think to your question about the particulars of the deal that it's the role of Congress I certainly am not going to support any amendments that go in and try and micromanage this deal this is a you know an agreement obviously that's been negotiated for the past three years between the railroads and the unions and of course now most lately lately with the bite administration's blessing but I don't think it's I don't think Congress wants to get into the weeds and start negotiating the fine points of of these agreements between management and labor but as you know this could this could be thrown off and there could be a full-on strike what do you believe are the economic implications what's at risk here well that's a that's a big issue I mean and I represent a state that's very dependent upon railroads railroads are the best way to ship bull Commodities and we have a lot of bull Commodities we're in agricultural state so the consequences of a shutdown would be catastrophic and that has to be avoided the question is what's the best way to do that and uh like a lot of our members are coming to the conclusion that the best way to conclude this is again to force the parties back to the table okay we'll keep watching it Senator appreciate you joining us thanks Sandra um Senator if you could stand by with us because we are going to hear from one of those unions in just a second but we want to turn to one other topic before you go our own peter Ducey questioning White House Press Secretary Kareem Jean-Pierre on what the White House meant when she said that the White House is keeping a close eye on Twitter listen to this when you say that you're going to be monitoring some of the speech on there if you see something that you like would you try to shut Twitter down so look you know when you when you talk about monitoring you know it is uh I I hate to break it to you Peter just like everybody else we very much monitor the news we pay close attention to everything that you all are reporting and and Twitter's in the news a lot and so that's what we're paying attention to how did you interpret that senator I don't know how to interpret that I mean it's not the White House's job to moderate the content that goes on social media platforms you know clearly and I'm somebody who believes in more transparency for for big tech for social media platforms that they need to inform customers and consumers about the use of algorithms opaque algorithms to to influence or manipulate the content that people see but I certainly would not want the White House determining what is and isn't acceptable in terms of content to put be put on these platforms and that certainly seemed to be the the implication of what was being said there Senator appreciate Andrew okay

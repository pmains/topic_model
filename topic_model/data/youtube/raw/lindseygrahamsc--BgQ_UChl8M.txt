Senator Lindsey Graham South Carolina he joins us with the very latest senator welcome back I apparently just told one of my producers that you just spoke with the president yeah basically we're going to counter-attack the virus we're going to starve it we're going to bomb it and we're going to kill it the way you starve it is you stop human to human transmission social distancing will starve the virus the way you bomb it is drug therapies that you were talking about we're going to bomb the hell out of it we're gonna take it from attend to hopefully do one or two and eventually we're going to kill it with a vaccine until then we're going to stabilize the economy and make sure you get income coming from the fact you've lost your job to no fault of your own but the containment policies that will pay dividends we're paying for them now all right and this is gonna be only those Americans you agreed with me the other night this should be a clean bill only Americans and it's I mean it's got to be at a level where Americans can keep their homes paid their rent keep their cars and not have to pull their kids out of college correct yes what we're going to do you've lost your job because of we decided to contain the virus by requiring us to stay away from each other so you can't go to work so you're going to have your income replaced either through unemployment insurance or the Marco Rubio idea of where companies can go borrow money and make their payroll so we're going to keep the income coming to you it's going to take a while to get there but you're going to have an income stream you can rely upon as we work together to defeat the virus we're going to starve it we're going to bomb it through drug therapies and the president is working on accelerating a vaccine that is the most promising idea I've heard yet let's talk about removing the the burdensome regulations to move all the chloroquine and yeah from des aveer and this plasma blood with those that have been infected this is these are huge I've read a lot especially about chloroquine and apparently early signs are for me reading medical research I was impressed yeah so what the president is doing is saying get the hell out of the way when it comes to developing drug therapies get them to the marketplace these drug therapies are very promising they can take the virus from being lethal to non-lethal they can take it from attend to to we're going to bomb the hell out of it with drug therapies just like you described but the way you eventually kill it is through a vaccine it takes a year or more to get a vaccine to the market we're going to try to cut that in half all right let me

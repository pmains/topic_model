good afternoon i'm congresswoman lori trahan thank you for taking the time to join our seventh covid19 teletown hall before we talk about what the future looks like for our state i want to start off by acknowledging the incredibly painful moment that we're facing as a country right now like many of you i've been closely monitoring what's happening in minneapolis where yet another black man became a victim of excessive and unnecessary force at the hands of law enforcement i've seen the video of george floyd's horrific murder and i've watched the interviews of his loved ones talking about how his presence and their lives was stolen from them i've listened to my friends black parents talk about the fear they have for their children growing up in a country that doesn't value them not being able to dream the same dreams as i can for my children afraid that their black son could be murdered while out for a run as a mother it's devastating to know that in this country in 2020 black and brown children still face so many systemic obstacles to achieving their goals in life simply because of the color of their skin this is a problem that requires all of us to take responsibility and action in solving it requires everyone to lean in and say no more no more racial profiling no more hate and brutality and no more militarization of law enforcement as we spend the next hour answering your questions about how to responsibly reopen our state it's important that we not lose focus of the values and humanity we aspire to as a country so that the promise of better days indeed lie ahead for everyone before we get to the q a i'd like to acknowledge our two incredible panelists we're joined today by mark fuller who is helping lead our state's reopening effort as the under secretary for business growth in the executive office of housing and economic development and dr john welch who has been spearheading the commonwealth's contact tracing initiative as the director of partnerships and operations at partners in health now before i turned over to them to introduce themselves i'd like to update you on where we are as a country and what congress is doing to alleviate both the public health crisis and the economic burdens americans are facing in just three months we've lost a hundred thousand americans to covet nineteen including over six thousand six hundred and forty right here in massachusetts i'd like to just pause so that we can all just observe a moment of silence to honor those who have lost their lives to this virus as well as their loved ones who are still mourning their loss thank you as we begin to slow to to begin the slow process of reopening the economic toll of this virus continues to climb yesterday we received the latest unemployment numbers 2.1 million filed for unemployment in the past week bringing our national total to almost 41 million since mid-march that includes 1.4 million people here in the commonwealth who have applied since the beginning of this outbreak these numbers are staggering and honestly they're overwhelming we must remember that behind these statistics are real people lives that have been cut short families currently struggling to cope with the passing of loved ones and parents facing extreme economic uncertainty the harsh reality is that these numbers would be even higher had we not stayed home worn masks and practiced social distancing and it's for this reason we must continue to embrace all of these risk mitigation tactics it's important that we continue to do our jobs to slow the spread of clovid 19 so that frontline heroes can continue doing theirs although the number of new cases and hospitalizations has been decreasing medical professionals are still working around the clock to save lives the state and federal government has been working closely to fight back against the virus and its economic toll and before i hand it over to the governor's team to discuss the reopening strategy i'd like to share what we've been doing at the federal level to deliver assistance to the commonwealth to date congress has passed and the president has signed into law nearly three trillion dollars in emergency relief funding to keep families and small businesses afloat to keep our heroes on the front lines of this fight safe and dramatically expand access to coronavirus testing at no cost however each time we see tragic stories of loved ones falling ill and dying from this disease and continue to watch unemployment numbers climb it becomes even more obvious that more help is needed to get through this pandemic two weeks ago i was in washington to cast my vote for the heroes act this historic legislation delivers on many of the needs of our healthcare heroes our first responders and our essential workers while also getting additional assistance to families and individuals just trying to keep a roof over their head or put food on the table specifically the heroes act includes one trillion dollars in funding for state and local governments to ensure that our frontline heroes are getting paid these funds will ensure that when someone gets sick and needs to get to the hospital an ambulance and emt will be there for them for those struggling under the financial weight of this crisis this legislation provides a second round of direct cash payments of up to twelve hundred dollars per person and up to six thousand dollars per family it includes 175 billion dollars to help those having trouble making their mortgage rent and utility payments and it sets aside another 14 billion dollars for food security programs so no one goes hungry to keep people safe as states like ours work toward reopening the heroes act provides an additional 75 billion dollars to expand access to covid19 testing and treatment and to bolster tracing initiatives that will be key to preventing another surge for our children this package sets aside 90 billion dollars for state and local governments to support schools including 1.5 billion specifically to close the digital divide by getting wi-fi to families without reliable access to the internet to keep workers safe the harrows act requires workplaces to implement infectious outbreak protocols to limit the spread of covid19 and for those who have lost their jobs because of this pandemic it expands access to health coverage by increasing federal subsidies for cobra premiums this was one of my highest priorities for the heroes act and i'm glad we were able to get it included the bill also creates a special open enrollment window to get health care coverage through the aca exchanges and finally to help our smallest of small businesses our mom and pop stores our bodegas the heroes act strengthens the paycheck protection program to ensure that federal relief is getting to the businesses that need it most although this legislation includes much-needed relief for families across our state and throughout the country the senate has refused to vote on the bill choosing instead to take a wait-and-see approach passing the heroes act becomes more urgent each day and i will continue pressing for that additional aid now i'd like to take a moment to introduce our guests our first panelist is mark fuller the undersecretary of business growth at the executive office of housing and economic development he most recently served as the chief of staff at the ms bay transit authority and before that he worked as the director of performance management in the governor's office in his current role mark is responsible for advancing the state strategy for job creation and business development across the commonwealth he has also been key in helping to implement the governor's reopening plan i'm grateful to him for taking the time out of his busy schedule to be here to answer your questions welcome mark thanks so much for having me and really appreciate the opportunity to come and talk about our four phase strategy for reopening massachusetts responsibly while we continue to fight covet 19. i know there are a number of questions that we'll get to in a moment but i just would love to stress that we are trying to take an approach that is that is guided by public health data and key indicators at its core we are continuing monitoring monitoring those public health metrics for progress and those metrics will always determine whether we advance to future phases and it's really incumbent upon all of us as we all know to do our best to cover our faces wash our hands socially distance be vigilant for symptoms and of course stay home if you're feeling sick as we do introduce more and more activity across the state so pleased to be here and i'm looking forward to answering the questions thank you and we do we have a we have a good uh a good roster of questions for you uh our second guest is also working tirelessly to keep people safe as our state begins the reopening process dr john welch is the director of partnerships and operations that partners in health clovid19 responds from massachusetts in this role dr welch leads our state's first in the nation approach to tracing contacts of covid positive patients something we know is key to limiting the spread of this virus in the long term dr welch also has a depth of experience as a health care professional in addition to his role at partners in health he is also boston children's hospital senior nurse in aesthetics and anaesthetist and a pediatric nurse anesthesia fellowship director sorry about that dr welch and in the past he worked in ebola ravaged regions of haiti and west africa dr welsh thank you for coming to join us today would you like to just introduce yourself and talk a little bit about your work sure um yeah thank you so much for having me and um certainly that uh that title is a tricky one uh even while i was training to be a a nurse anesthetist it took me a while to uh to be able to yeah no problems there um yeah so uh i i appreciate the invite to speak and um to share our experience uh and kind of where where we are and where we're going um i do want to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible work that is happening um at the local level um you know the local boards of health um around massachusetts of which there are 351 have really been the leaders and the experts in contact tracing um long before covet 19 began um contact tracing is part of their sort of essential duties for over 90 different reportable infectious diseases and i just want to kind of give a nod to those public health nurses and health directors and health agents who have really um known all along that contact tracing is an essential public health activity to getting to the bottom of an epidemic like this one and really raised the flag early to say uh we know how important this is and so we want to uh to try and ask for support and try and bolster our contact tracing work from the local level up to the to the commonwealth level so um looking forward to taking questions but i really wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the the expert public health uh officials there at the local level well thank you thank you for acknowledging our local boards of health certainly uh you know we've been working so closely uh with the cities and towns uh health boards that we represent and they have been thrust into this pandemic serving on the front lines and and really staying in close uh contact with you know their community hospitals with their community with their nursing facilities and has really done some amazing work so mark our first question is for you from margaret m in marlborough and she would like to hear more about plans for reopening the economy in massachusetts and what steps specifically will be taken to ensure safety great well thank you i i would first of all encourage everyone to go and take a look at the reopening massachusetts report which was published on may 18th which was produced by the reopening advisory board and chaired by lieutenant governor polito and housing and economic development secretary mike kennealy it's available on mass.gov backslash reopening and i think what you'll see in there is that the members of the reopening advisory board which were comprised of public health experts municipal leaders members of the business community really tried to put together a thoughtful fourth phase strategy to responsibly reopen massachusetts the board in three short weeks met with 75 different stakeholder groups industry associations regional chambers community coalitions and labor organizations that represented over 100 000 businesses and 2 million workers so it's a really comprehensive piece of work and at its heart what it does is it lays out a path forward for the state in four phases with industries and sectors and activities that present present the least amount of risk opening in early phases and those that present more risk opening in later phases and we tried to be very methodical in thinking about which industries fit into which phase and understanding that as we move through these phases we're going to have to continue to fight covet 19 and the decision making process around what happens in each phase when we move from phase to phase will be guided by public health data and key indicators and those indicators are actually made public every day through the covid command center and there's a dashboard that's put out that everyone can can look at and has sort of green yellow red indicators on sort of key metrics that the state is looking at it's really important to note that as we advance to future phases we're not thinking about dates but we're thinking about data and so we're in phase one right now and we're gonna let at least three weeks pass and possibly longer before a phase two could start and that's really important because we need to closely monitor public health data trends and if things turn negative or if there's specific areas or regions that flare up we might need to return to an earlier phase or regress back to sort of earlier protocols part of that plan lays out the safer at home advisory which which includes a lot of general social guidance around covering your face washing your hands socially distancing being vigilant for symptoms and staying at home but also makes very clear mandatory workplace safety standards that businesses need to follow checklists and protocols for industries and specific sectors depaul so they can open up and open safely with lots of restrictions and guidance around hygiene and social distancing and it also provides an avenue for businesses to attest to their ability to reopen they need to display that attestation publicly and has a lot of information for both employers and employees about how to think about reopening in a responsible way and that plan and there's a covet response plan that each company that does reopen needs to write and have handy is available for any enforcement authorities with the local board of public health and municipality or estate entities but it's really important as we think about moving through those phases that everyone businesses and individuals behaves just as responsibly as possible and that we work together to defeat kovid and again it's a lot of very common sense things around covering your face washing your hands socially distancing and being vigilant and staying home if you're sick and i would say if you are a business owner and thinking about gee how which phase might i fall into there's a lot of guidance for that on the website there's all that sector specific guidance and business guidance is also available for download it's been translated into multiple languages i'd really encourage everyone to go spend some time with those materials because they're quite comprehensive and give everyone a path of sort of where we're headed for this but i can't stress enough that the public health metrics and data are driving our decision making here and i'm so pleased that dr welch is on the phone because his work and the work of so many great doctors and healthcare professionals are really dictating how we think about moving through the phases i'd also say that we're looking very closely at how other states are reopening and thinking about reopening and other geographies but it's always important to keep in mind when you read about other places covid may have impacted their communities differently than ours and we are unfortunately one of the state's hardest hit by covid and so we're trying to take a very conservative approach and methodical approach to reopening so i hope that gives a flavor of what's in there first phases included central businesses construction and manufacturing and a few personal services things like car washes and and the like well thank you and it does segue to dr welch and the the next question which is certainly the science aspect of this and bernard c from lowell is he's curious about what level of testing and tracing is currently planned for uh the economy to reopen yeah um so thank you for that question and and thanks uh mark um for kind of setting this one up for me um and i think this is the right question to to ask um i'm to kind of take it in a couple of parts and the first part is that we are really leading the nation in terms of one of the most important pieces of a response like that like this and that is uh creating the capacity necessary um to begin reopening and by that i mean the capacity for testing and the capacity for contact tracing um you know i've been uh fortunate to be consulted in different places around the country that um that are still sort of sitting back and waiting or wondering the best path forward for things like contact tracing and so you know where we're at in massachusetts is really reflection of the leadership here to be a bit visionary and to really listen to public health experts in the midst of a of a novel virus you know a novel virus like this we don't yet have a vaccine we don't yet have a cure and so we've got to take a step back and instead of relying on those things that we typically lean on in our health care system we've got to take a broader view and realize that it's actually a public health response that will get us back to a place of reopening so and the first really the first step in that is is generating the capacity necessary to get to the place in the epidemic where we can start thinking about reopening and so that was really kind of the effort of social distancing and the stay-at-home orders that allows um a system to come into place and us the opportunity to really scale up in that testing capacity and put together a a comprehensive contact tracing endeavor that will sort of bolster what's happening at the local level um so what does all of that mean um in terms of uh the current capacity for testing and tracing um we're in a place now that um that we can greatly broaden who's eligible for testing early in an epidemic like this when when testing is new for any new virus you've got to generate testing platforms and so once those were up and running and those were scaled up in a way that could be rolled out then you have to start um prioritizing who is eligible for testing and i think we all experienced that um early in the epidemic knowing that healthcare workers and front-line workers and um first responders were very quickly eligible for testing and then um individuals who were symptomatic um but were eligible for testing and able to receive those those tests but now we've moved into a phase where we have the capacity to start testing other at-risk individuals what do i mean by at-risk individuals these are people that have been identified as known close contacts of someone who's tested positive for covis and that's where contact tracing comes in contact tracing in a public health response is really the tie that binds all the activities together and so when we when we go about contact tracing the first person we speak to is someone who's already tested positive for cobid and we ask them to help us understand who they've been in close contact with um in the 48 hours prior to developing symptoms close contact is uh someone you've been around within six feet for 15 minutes or more and as we develop those those lists of contacts then we reach out to those individuals and now we're in a place in this epidemic here in massachusetts where we have the capacity to now start referring those contacts for testing even if they don't have symptoms and by keeping in close touch with those contacts for the entire incubation period which for covetous 14 days we're able to keep close tabs on how they're doing if they've been tested if they should go get tested and then continue to encourage them to stay away from other individuals to break the chains of transmission so by i love this question because it combines testing and tracing together and that's exactly what has to happen um in order for us to break the chains of transmission and be much more focused in our stay at home um endeavors right so early on everyone needed to stay away from each other everyone needed to stay home now that we have a robust contact tracing system and we've got the capacity for testing we can really zero in on exactly who should be staying home and those individuals are folks who have been in close contact with someone who's tested positive and the only way for them to really get that guidance is through the contact tracing uh effort so um our capacity is there to provide both of those things here in massachusetts and and again um we're kind of ahead of the curve there and uh you know govern governor baker secretary sutters and and uh others within the command center have really been um really been visionary in in leading uh not just massachusetts but i think the country and pushing folks towards uh leaning on the public health response uh to get us kind of down this mountain while we wait for a vaccine thank you for that you know in our previous teletown hall i think was the last one uh our guest was uh dr sebetti who is part of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at harvard and she spoke to us about the importance of balancing public health and economic revival and when she was on uh dr sebetti described to us the importance of rooting our decisions and science and data of course and using contact tracing so that we can isolate cases and direct resources as opposed to resorting to the blunt instrument of shutting down the entire uh economy but i have to tell you it was so helpful to get that tutorial on exactly how it works um in terms of you know uh the the um opening up the supply of tests uh so that you know when when you're when you're calling all of those folks who have come into contact we can now send them to get a test and even further uh you know isolate those you know cases so thank you thank you for that uh this next question is for me it's from mary jo b and groton and she asks what can be done to assure adequate financial resources at the state and local level for the heightened degree of testing and contact tracing needed to protect the public as we roll out a reopening of the massachusetts economy and will the federal government provide that type of finance financial support to states so thank you mary jo it sort of flows beautifully with this uh this line of questioning the short answer is yes the federal government needs to invest in a national testing infrastructure and congress has appropriated funds specifically to testing as well as to our states that desperately need assistance combating the virus um as many states across our country including the common including the commonwealth they as they lift their stay-at-home orders and they shift uh into a phased reopening the only way to proceed safely is by having robust testing and contact tracing programs in place and i firmly believe that any move to reopen needs to be grounded in science facts and metrics uh as you know laid out by by mark and um dr welch because by acting in haste or on whims we're essentially putting lives at risk uh it's important to note that despite moves to reopen we are still in the midst of a pandemic and researchers have yet to develop a vaccine while the growth in positive clovid 19 cases has slowed throughout our country this disease still lurks in too many of our communities so we're not out of the woods and testing tracing and treating will be our guide to how we reopen how we live and work until there is a vaccine congress has passed several noteworthy funding measures to support our states and our municipalities the cares act which became law allocated 150 billion dollars for the coronavirus relief fund which essentially helped states with costs incurred due to their response uh to this health emergency and then through the cdc 1.5 billion dollars in grants to support states and cities and towns with the purchase of ppe testing contact tracing and other preparedness and response activities the heroes act which we voted on two weeks ago went even further this one hasn't passed yet passed through the house but not yet the senate it would provide an additional 75 billion dollars for public health departments and workforce agencies to test trace and treat for covid19 and nearly one trillion dollars for state and local governments that need funds to pay essential workers to keep us safe and keep the economy afloat that specifically includes 500 billion dollars for states of which massachusetts would get roughly 12 billion and 375 billion dollars for local governments totaling uh 10.7 billion for local governments across massachusetts and 678 million for cities and towns here in the third district and my conversations with the governor mayors and city managers across this district each one further emphasizes the dire need for greater aid which is why we're pushing the senate to come to the negotiating table to take up legislation that continues to address these funding shortfalls so i hope this answers your question mary jo thank you mark timothy b from acton wants to know if massachusetts is working with other new england states on reopening and can you share some ideas on restrictions limitations and safeguards sure that's a great question from from timothy and i'm happy to report that massachusetts is working closely with a number of states in the northeast that our neighbors and i think on it was on april 13th we officially joined a coalition of six states to form a multi-state council to facilitate coordination among among and about the region to reopen economic activity a lot of that work has to do with ensuring that businesses can resume safely and then the measures in place uh protect against the spread of coven 19. particularly as economic activity you know spreads throughout the region a lot of a lot of business that we do starts or ends in new hampshire or connecticut or rhode island or new york and so we're trying to make sure that as we move through phases we're doing it in a sensible manner that doesn't put doesn't put any state too far out ahead or too far behind any of any of its um any of its approximate neighbors because that would lead to a lot of challenges you know with that said individual state plans have differences about how and when businesses and activities are going to resume and it's incumbent upon all of us to make sure that we're following all the advice that dr welch and other health care experts and public health experts give us so we don't have to have any sort of a relapse or move backwards and i think that is reflected in what you're seeing across new england and also reflective in our measured approach as we move from from what was our stay-at-home order to this phase one posture which we're calling start and the safer at home order um with very limited set of industries opening the the good news is we're working very closely with all the other states and continue to plan to do that great thank you and dr welch brenda d from lowell asks everything i'm listening to is telling me that there will not be a vaccine for this fall uh how do we expect to control this without the need to shelter in place again yeah um great question and i'll start by just recognizing um i think both of my questions so far have come from lowell um and uh we've got a great uh working relationship with your health director joanne there um in lowell and uh she's just working tirelessly as are the public health nurses there um to keep you all safe so uh it's great to to make these connections um to the folks that joanne and her team are serving so um thanks for that um so i will say a couple of things i'll caveat my answer a couple of ways first of all i am not a virologist um you know the folks who typically develop vaccines um and i'm certainly not a pessimist but i am quite realistic and i think that in these circumstances the science will sort of set us free um and so i want to be very clear that even even if a vaccine is very rapidly developed and i understand the pressure that's on our um our virologists and others to develop these vaccines um in really short order um we should all sort of take pause and allow a well-established scientific process to play out in a way um to be sure that the vaccine is something that doesn't create more problems for us and that it truly is something that will help keep us safe and so while while we all feel this urgency because we want to get back to some sense of normalcy we do have to let that process um take place and and they're working faster i think than uh we've really ever seen in in the history of um of uh vaccine development um and it's also wonderful and fascinating to know that that a lot of that research is happening here in massachusetts and um indeed the basic science research that goes into understanding even you know how a coronavirus um works uh has come out of out of so many of our fine institutions here in massachusetts so uh we should be proud of that as well um and and then the sec the second piece of developing a vaccine is then and once it's tested and it's it's found to be effective uh rolling out a vaccine campaign uh not just across a region or a single state or one country but across the entire world is really a huge endeavor and so a wonderful landmark will be development of an effective vaccine the next landmark though will be very much in uh creating a rollout strategy across the entire world um and that is daunting um but i i want everyone to kind of start thinking about that timeline as well so now that we've kind of established what that the the important pieces of what a vaccine uh development is we've got to uh talk about what we do in the meantime and in the meantime we have to rely on this public health response which is testing tracing treating and at the community tracing collaborative and partners in health we also talk about support because supporting those who are isolated or quarantined is essential for those things to be effective but that is the way testing tracing treating and support is the way to avoid a general stay-at-home order a general lockdown once more and so that means that we need folks to cooperate and understand that contact tracing is a well-established public health activity that has been found to be effective for over a century in breaking chains of trans of viral transmission and i'll just add that you know my experience in west africa during the ebola epidemic you know where we were developing novel treatments novel therapies and developing a vaccine all at the same time you would sometimes sit at the end of the day and think how in the heck are we ever going to get to the end of this and it could be very disheartening at times but the answer always came back to a well-coordinated and well-trusted public health response if we keep going back to testing tracing treating and support that's how we ended the ebola epidemic in west africa and it's an incredible moment to to uh declare an epidemic over and i think in this covet epidemic we're going to see sort of um our public health strategy flow into a vaccine campaign and um i just want everybody to know that these these strategies these public health strategies are proven and they work and if we have everyone's trust um together we can avoid again a general lockdown a a general stay-at-home order while while we wait for that vaccine oh that's so uh that's so important for us to you know hear over and over again is that you know the actions that we take actually um helps break that chain of of transmission and you know i'll even take this opportunity to note that uh you know the the success of our contact tracing is incumbent upon people picking up that phone call right so that prefix on your caller id is 833 or 857 and if you do get one of those phone calls it's just as important to pick up that call as it is to wear a mask and to wash our hands because what we're actually doing by participating is you know flat continuing to flatten that curve continuing to as you said and i'll probably repeat over and over break the chain of transmission so thank you for that uh this next question is for me it's from floyd in haverhill and he writes i'm 61 i have heart disease and i'm diabetic when this started i got a note from my doctor stating that i should not get exposed and this still applies how do i start to work again my company let me go but said that they would rehire me so floyd thank you and i have to say i'm i'm so happy to hear that your doctor was so proactive about communicating the precautions that you had to take worker safety is is a top priority the reason we mandated paid sick leave and paid family and medical leave and the cares act is because we have to protect people like you you know there are more than 32 million people across the united states without access to any paid sick leave at all and millions more who cannot earn paid medical leave to take care of a sick child or a family member this pandemic has had a devastating impact on workers especially workers earning less than a living wage by by ensuring that we expand comprehensive family paid family and medical leave we are supporting working families and we're saving lives and when returning to work you need to feel safe many of you may feel fearful or anxious about heading back to work which is completely warranted we've seen coven 19 spread like wildfire across essential industries that remained open without infection control plans you know some of them are long-term care centers some in our packaging facilities and that's why in addition to expanding worker protections and benefits robust testing and contact tracing are so critical those are going to be key to securing both worker and consumer confidence in this phased reopen but no one should return to work if they're feeling at risk or unwell if if you are indeed returning to work i think it's it's imperative that you know your rights and the protections as well as what to do if you're put in a vulnerable position by your employer in massachusetts as part of phase one governor baker issued broad worker safety rules as well as industry specific guidelines and according to those guidelines all workers are required to practice social distancing and wear face coverings for those with underlying conditions like cancer or diabetes which puts you at a higher risk for complications you should absolutely speak to your employer about accommodations to ensure your safety keep in mind that those with with health impairments are also protected from discrimination under both state and federal laws in other words your employer is required to make sure that the workplace is safe so that you're able to return without contracting the virus and if if you're not you should absolutely call your local board of health to report any violation you can also contact the ag's office the heroes that i will say the heroes act which we voted for a few weeks back it requires the department of labor under osha to expand their protections to ensure that all workplaces that are open develop infection control plans it also prevents employers from retaliating against workers who report or blow the whistle on health and safety standards in heroes we also expanded uh paid sick and family medical leave so that those who need time to care for themselves or for a loved one can do so without fear of losing their job and then lastly um i'll just say that this pandemic has further exposed us to glaring structural issues that plague our working families and our vulnerable communities and moving through and beyond this crisis we must implement policies that put our nation on the right track to an equitable system it's unjust and dangerous to revive our economy at the expense of workers health which i think is the message that you're hearing from dr welch and mark on this on this call in terms of the phases being determined by data and not dates so i thank you for your question floyd and uh certainly if you have questions along the way uh call our office we're at 978-459-0101 again that's 978-459-0101 and we'd be happy to to to work with you uh and give you good guidance okay we are this hour always goes by so quickly mark this next question uh is actually near and dear to all of us working moms joanie l from fitchburg asks what supports will be in place to support early childhood businesses so that they can afford to stay in business and support the people heading back to work well that's a a great question joanie and child care is such an important key enabler for families and individuals who are trying to return to work and it's one of the key work streams that we're spending a lot of time on along with items like transportation things both different things that enable us to get back to work and to try to use as safely as possible right now our mission is to reopen and increase access to child care and youth programs while continuing to protect both children and staff and preventing the spread of covet 19 and the departments of early education and care as well as the public health department are currently developing guidelines that try to strike that balance between families need for children for child care with health and safety you know core to that core to that support and i know children's hospital is helping us evaluate the right set of guidelines to uh to put out certainly the initial reopening is going to focus on families who have no safe alternative to group care by increasing emergency child care capacity right now the emergency child care program has that has about approximately ten thousand seats available for children and might and the latest facts and figures i saw was that they uh only 3 500 or so of those seats are being utilized so the good news is we do have some existing capacity and we're going to work incredibly hard here as we continue to reopen to increase that capacity and to provide support for folks and small businesses in the child care space so i'd say more to come on that and that there is some capacity right now if you're uh someone looking to get back to work well thank you mark and i'll just say you know on the on the federal level um the uh well what we've seen is child care providers who receive minimal public assistance they operate like a small business and they're no exception in terms of their struggles uh you know kind of staying afloat during this this ongoing pandemic uh the cares act and heroes you know provided an important necessary funding boost to some facilities but it's not enough i have to say i'm an original co-sponsor of the child care is essential act which would provide a direct federal investment to child care providers in order to stabilize this this critical industry i mean i i can't emphasize enough how vital this is to our economic recovery so thanks joanie and thanks mark it's such an important question for all of us uh dr welch kevin s from lowell again from lowell asked with a very small sign of cases dropping off how likely will we see a second wave of cases in massachusetts yeah a great question and and certainly if i could answer it um a lot of a lot of folks would want to talk to me right now i wish i could predict that um you know those of us in science and medicine like to predict and control um and unfortunately uh the an epidemic like this um doesn't uh doesn't always follow the rule book so um so what we have to do in order to try to predict and control is to continue to drive um these these public health measures um and you know uh it's it's so heartening to hear that the um that the reopening is really uh framed in this idea of public health metrics as the driver for moving from one phase to the next and that i think is one of the most important um tools that we have to try to prevent a major uh second wave of cases um you know i just finished a couple of meetings right before this uh where i had to say numerous times you know a day or two or even a week does not make a trend in a month-long epidemic we've gotta really zoom out and take a close look at what's happening not just in massachusetts but surrounding states and across the country [Music] to really understand if we're moving in the right direction and also try to zero in on places where we aren't so successful in breaking the chains of transmission and i think this goes back to um what the congresswoman was was mentioning before about equity and this epidemic has really um uh reiterated for all of us the the the historic and chronic um injustices and structural uh violence that exists in our in our country that uh causes our our working class and you know the working poor to suffer um far more greatly than than other populations are suffering and so that's you know that's that's my job is to recognize those inequities and to really push our response to those places um because uh all epidemics are local and so when you when you get to that local level when you get to that one-on-one level that's where you can really make an impact on um on preventing a second surge of cases that's why our local boards of health are so important and we're doing everything that we can to uh to to bolster the work that they're that they're doing um you know we're very quickly i know we're out of time but i just want to tell this quick story um i was speaking to the health director in randolph massachusetts and uh he was sharing with me that they spent weeks and weeks trying to build their sand castle and by that he meant you know they stacked up they moved their budget around they they trained uh you know additional people and doing uh contact tracing and case investigation and they felt really like they had built this beautiful sand castle to respond to covet and he said you know a couple weeks in we saw the waves starting to lap at the base of the sand castle until one morning he came in and the sand castle had just been totally washed away um and he was devastated not because his beautiful sand castle was washed away but because he thought that was a reflection of the work that they at the local level weren't able to do and so you know by having by being in a state with visionary leadership by um you know being represented like someone uh like the congresswoman who's able to talk about structural injustice and um by coming together in this way and letting you know science drive some of the policy when it comes to an epidemic we're we're so well positioned to be in a place to prevent that second wave so um that's prevention now is um what's so important uh to getting to being in a place where we where we're taking the steps to avoid that second wave and i think that's exactly what mark and his team have focused on so much is to use the science and the public health metrics to avoid that second wave so we're watching trends closely um we like day over day declines but we also you know there's so many factors that go into some of those daily case reports so we do zoom out and look at overall trends and and try to let those really drive the rest of the policy around what happens here in massachusetts that's great thank you thank you for that answer it's uh i know where we are running out of time i've got a question from catherine k from draket uh she wrote with this stimulus package my husband and i were eligible for the twenty four hundred dollars i have twins that are 18 and uh and 20 years old they're not eligible for anything they work they go to school and they are are dependent eligible dependents 17 and under get 500 but ages 18 and over get nothing why is that it's a great question catherine uh this oversight in the law uh should be fixed to provide some context for everyone else the cares act authorized economic impact payments 1200 for individuals 2400 for married couples who filed joint returns and the rebate was phased out for higher income earners but it also provided 500 per qualifying child dependent under the age of 17 which was based on the rules of the child tax credit but there was a loophole to this relief from cares which left out dependents over the age of 17 and that's a lot of young people who were excluded as a result you know two of my three steps included uh you know the reason why we went back uh to vote for the heroes act and it fixes that problem it ensures that a household with dependents who are likely full-time students and below the age of 24 in addition to adult dependence um uh would also receive the 500 rebate amount so we're working on that fix catherine uh thank you for that question hey before i wrap up dr welch you talked so much about the contact tracing and the investment robsie from lancaster quickly wants to know are there are job openings as a are there job openings to be a contact tracer and if so how would one apply yeah great question i'll i'll start by saying um we've had nearly 50 000 people apply um to work with the the community tracing collaborative which says two things to me the first is that we're in this moment where there are a lot of people who need work um and and so you know i think uh the the command center and governor baker uh saw this opportunity right to to address some of those those job needs but also that that number nearly 50 000 people shows uh illustrates for me how seriously people are taking their role in getting to the end of this epidemic everybody who i had the opportunity to meet um to to interview or listen to some of their interviews talked about their strong desire to want to help so i just i have to acknowledge that that being said at the moment we're we're pretty well fully staffed and that doesn't mean folks can't apply they can go to pih.org to apply or to math.gov and look for the community tracing collaborative page and apply you know during epidemics we do see periods of attrition as uh some folks are able to go back to their uh primary uh jobs um or you know changes in circumstances that some jobs open up and we would we welcome more applications and also i'll just say that even if folks can't work as as contact tracers um i'll just reiterate this idea that but the response really lies in all of our hands um it is washing your hands it's wearing a mask but it's also you know answering the call from the community tracing collaborative or from your local board of health it is trying to keep track of who your close contacts have been so that if you do become sick you've got that information available and really realizing that you know we we rise and fall as one as one group um and so it's up to all of us to take care of and to really um to save each other um from from coven oh that's that's a great uh closing message uh i want to thank mark fuller and dr john welch once more for sharing their expertise with us and and keeping us informed about the reopening here in massachusetts we're so grateful for your time and and for your service and thank you to everyone again for dialing in and committing yourself to staying informed for an easy way to stay updated on the federal and state response to 19 as well as information on our future teletown halls and events please follow us on instagram facebook twitter it's at rep lori trahan you can also visit our our website trahan.house.gov covid19 which has specific resources important to you and your family your small business the reason we do these town halls is so that we can arm you with the facts uh facts from experts these are uncertain times and i know right now it's hard not to be able to plan for school in the fall what work will look like for the rest of the year or a definitive timeline for a vaccine i don't have all the answers and frankly i don't believe that elected officials should pretend to it's dangerous when when politicians are frankly talking heads on tv for that matter venture into subject matter that they don't know about or were spread inaccurate information so please continue to seek out the facts from scientists from doctors from epidemiologists economists even much of our fate will be determined by how we fight this virus and protect our collective health while we wait for that vaccine and in the meantime we have a responsibility to protect each other for most of us that means staying at home washing our hands maintaining a safe social distance and always wearing a mask when we go out in public i know it can feel insignificant but trust me it's absolutely essential to keeping our essential and emergency workers healthy so we will get through this difficult time and as long as each of us continues to do our part we'll get through it together so thank you again and stay safe and healthy

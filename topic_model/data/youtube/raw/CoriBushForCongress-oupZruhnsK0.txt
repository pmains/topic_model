rumbling in our country there's a rumbling in our world and so we got to
grab a hold of it right now and get everything we can get out of it we got
to squeeze it all to get everything that we can because we don't know if that
thing will come back around in our lifetimes then we have so much work to
do there are so many people hurting and that work is going us it's on each and
every one of us am i right huge shout out to matriarch so all of
these these organizations these PACs are supporting us and didn't have to it
still takes courage it may not be one person it's a group of people that made
a decision to say we'll put our we'll put our stamp on you we're going to use
you we're gonna take some of our political capital and spend it on you
and so I appreciate every single one matriarch says you as a progressive
working woman that doesn't have access to general wealth you deserve to be in
Congress because of what you stand for your policies and your values your
integrity your character that should be seated in Congress and we're trying to
make sure that there is parity in Congress and so we want to support you
so thank you to matriarch thank you to Nomiki and everybody that's a part of
that and so sunrise STL came right in and said you know what we understand
that there are issues and when we talk about the issues that we have as it
relates to fighting for fighting this this climate crisis we have to make sure
that we are highlighting voices of black and brown people who are highlighting
those who are disproportionately affected and making sure that they're on
the forefront of this thing and that's what sunrise STL has done for us and so
I salute them they make the calls even during Covid whatever was
happening sunrise STL has been there so thank you all all of you young people
I'm young too but not as young as you so thank you for what you're doing for is
brand new Congress you know we've been rocking since day one brand new Congress
came on the scene I was the very first brand new Congress candidate ever you
know and so brand new Congress again took that chance on me and said you know
what we love your story we love what you're doing and we want to help support
that and push that forward and so thank you for being there for always standing
up for me always standing up for me I just I can never I can I can just I can

road and you know I do the same for you which I have done so thanks for all of
your work and just as Democrats JD I was the very first JD candidate ever let me
say that too and so thank you just as Democrats for supporting and being there
2018 we started in 2017 with brand new Congress and we're up - and we're here
now thank you for supporting again now see this is the thing when you pay
attention you pay attention to the fact that as someone who is supposedly
running against another progressive that's sitting in the seat that's been
there for twenty years but then you have true progressive groups that are that
that are the ones that are doing the real work the ones that are the notable
that there are some of the notable progressive groups but they're saying
that there is somebody else that's more progressive than the person that's in
the seat and they're willing to stand on it and they're willing to put their work
into it they're their money into it they're willing to do that that says
something so pay attention to that and let's make sure that we support these
organizations I mean these groups that are doing this work
shout out to Jamaal Bowman shout out congratulations you know can't wait to
see what you do to the squad to everybody that's out there doing great
work every organizer every group thank you so on my way here tonight well
earlier today on my way to the office we're at the Cori Bush campaign
headquarters let me just say that's where we are we this is our spots we
have our own stage we got our own space you know and we can social distance in
this fossil if you want to come you're welcome to come because we got some
space for you this is 3500 square feet just for you to be able to get get this
work done so we can win this so on my way here I had to drive past people who
were on housed sleeping on the ground I drove past it came on to the office I
drove past areas where homes look like a bomb
been dropped on it and I I drove past people that were working in places where
they were making I know they're making like $9 an hour you know I drove past an
area where people are let's just say they're living a life other than what
they would like to live right now let's just let's just put it like that I drove
past areas where there were not where you could have you I could have driven
for probably eight blocks and not come across one single grocery store these
things are still happening and we have had the same representative for 20 years
let me say just outside of this door less than less than one block away just
a few hours ago there was an officer-involved shooting right outside
this door of this office right outside this door I had to move with it when I
saw it I had to go step away into my office and just sit in the dark and sit
on the floor because I'm thinking to myself just two days ago you all saw the
video of what happened that night you didn't get to see a lot of what was
going on with me that night but you saw the video of what we went through that
night that was just that one night there had been nothing this midnight after
night after night but that was one night and I'm just thinking about how when the
officer maced me directly in my face as I reached in to try to grab someone that
those officers were beating with a baton women that fell back all they did was
fail back the officers had advanced on them and they failed back and the
officers jumped on top of them and just started beating them with batons and so
I reached in look let me tell you you're not gonna touch my people and I'm gonna
let you do that I'm sorry it's just not happening whether it's physical touch or
whatever I'm not allowing you to do it and I and I'm not gonna stand back it's not
gonna happen so I reached in to grab the people out as best I could in the
officer sprayed me so I was burning let me tell you I burn for 20 almost 24
hours like 22 hours my skin burned you know some people say that their skin started to come off like 
whatever the mace was whatever that chemical agent was how it how it hurt
and I was just thinking sitting in my office on the floor like I just went
through all of that we keep fighting we keep fighting we keep fighting and
thinking we're getting started getting somewhere and then they smash us again
we keep fighting we keep giving of ourselves and they hit us again but I
think we have people sitting in these seats that could have made change for us
all over the country that have not done it and they haven't done it because they
didn't have to they didn't have to because we weren't holding them
accountable enough because we'll go ahead and go to the ballot box yes I get
my voted sticker but did I research who I'm voting for then I do the proper work
to be educated so that's that's our work now so let me say you've heard some
stuff about who Cori is Cori is someone that cares not about who you love where
you live how much money you have what you don't have what school you went to
if you didn't go to school who your mama is I don't care about any of that what I
care about is what do you need because right now whatever your need is
that's where that's what I need to meet I need to do whatever I can to help you
meet that and the reason behind that is the root of that is I've been through so
much of those things myself and I know what that hurt was like I know what that
struggle feels like I know what that pain is like and so I can't just allow
people to just walk through those same things simply because it could happen
let me say me as your representative or even if I'm not your personal
representative let me tell you the work that I plan to do in Congress will
affect you because the work that I plan to do I want everybody to be able to
feel I want you to feel it I want your children to feel it and I want your
children's children to feel it that's the work that I plan to do and so let me
say we have a chance we say you know they think it's a game they think it's a
game they think it's a game it ain't no game
it ain't no game let me say that's how this is it's no game and right now is
the time we have less than four weeks to win this race four weeks less than four
weeks which means I need every single thing that you got and I'm asking for
word so you heard what I stand for yes I'm for Medicare for all because I don't
believe that anybody should lack health care I'm a registered nurse and I've
seen people die so when they don't have health care people die so it's a
no-brainer we can't have people dying so we need to give folks health care and so
I've lived in poverty I know what that's like and so a $15 an hour minimum wage
federal minimum wage is not too much to ask it's really not even enough
enough to ask for but that's something to make sure that our people have
something to start with so I'm coming for that we need to make sure that we
have that and so I'm fighting so yeah we're fighting for that because if we
get that then we can start really tackling some of this crime we have in
our communities we can really attack attack poverty in a real way that's just
a little bit of a piece of that and so I'm coming for that I'm I'm making sure
that people understand that a woman's right to her body is her own and so yes
I am a pro-choice Democrat I'm not rocking with the people that say that
you know that a woman has to give yeah and let me tell you this nobody else
shows up at the store with me when I have to go pick up my women's products
nobody hops on that table to do anything when I have to go see my gynecologist
nobody else house up there so my body is my own and any other woman's body it's
her own I fight I'm speaking up for our LGBT community I'm speaking up for our
and I'm singling out right now our trans our transgender folks because right now
those are the ones that are being targeted those are the ones being killed
especially our black our black trans people and so speaking up for people
that are not oppressed the same way that I am that's something that's our work
making sure that we do that so and I can go on and on about my policies and you
all know most of them and you can go to my website CoriBush.org to the issues
section you will see what i believe and you will see as your congresswoman what
i would do so we so will push that to the side cuz we only have a few more
minutes left for me to speak but let me say if you will take the time to give me
give this campaign your energy and your time for less than four weeks and I'm
saying push some stuff away I went to nursing school and I had to just block
everything out I had to say you know what this rotation is for six weeks so I
will sleep the day after the six weeks is over after I take that test I've been
out of sleep but up until then don't ask me about sleeping because it's not
happening in the same way I'm asked I'm asking you for that
I'm asking you for that because the work that I plan to do in Congress I plan to
make sure that you get the things that you need I'm going to work hard for you
if you work hard for me for these three of these three plus weeks I promise to
take two years and work hard for you let me say this it's no no more can we allow
this status quo to allow us to live the way that we're living fighting and
begging and and and and struggling the way that we have and we don't have to
this area is a democratic area but it you wouldn't know that it's a democratic
area the way that people are suffering there's no reason why st. Louis is
number one all the time for homicide number one for police murder number one
for crime it's no reason there's no reason with number one for chlamydia and
gonorrhea number two and all of that is no reason there is work that needs to be
done and I'm prepared to do it I'm ready to do it I've been doing it and I won't
close my mouth let me tell you this you're gonna say they won't sit me
down either way whether I win the seat or not I'm gonna do the work because
it's not about a title a name or fame it's about you're getting what you need and
you're getting it now I'm a nurse I was taught that we have to have measurable
outcomes so I want you to be able to measure what Cori did when I go to
Congress so I'm asking you take the next three plus weeks and help me so I need
you to get on the phones if you were going to offer us two shifts I'm asking
you to give me eight give me eight give me eight if you were gonna do you know
detect message in a couple of times I'm asking you do it 12 you know I need you
to help us turn this vote out because st. Louis deserves so much better than
what we have we've been under this under this oppression for so long and it's not
necessary it has to be leadership over legacy bump nostalgia nostalgia
does not put food in anyone's mouth it's time for you to thrive it's
time for st. Louis to have what we need we're not only St. Louis we're coming
for week once this happens in st. Louis I'm walking over to help the next well

you haven't but those of you think about if you have some type of bias some of
you like you know you'll give a whole lot of money to men and you don't
realize that you give the one or two digits the single digit or the double
digits to wait to women let me say this I'm not giving a less effort than any

not giving a less a lesser effort than anybody who is not a lawyer I'm giving

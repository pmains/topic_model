the actions of you know the media the actions of the administration the actions of certain members of congress i mean we have record crime spikes in our nation right now um you know people are being murdered by the dozens in major cities police officers are walking away from their job they're retiring at large numbers family members who have you know a tradition of police officers serving you know generation after generation are encouraging their children to go do something else and i think it has a lot to do with with the actions of not just congress the administration the media um but it's sending an awful message to the people i mean it's like you know police officers that it's called the thin blue line because they are the ones standing between you know civilization and the in the breakdown of society chaos murder and violence and um i believe that we should be funding our police officers and not defund them if you want them to have this training you want them to have the experience to to have everything that you want them to have we should be funding them more instead of tying and just basically tie in their hands and keeping them from being able to get the training that they need and they want it they desperately want it and you know it just seems like we're contradicting ourselves by having so many strings attached to the funding that they they're not going to be able to get the training they need or access the funding for that training

thank you madam chairman chief did well good to see you thanks for your previous visits to North Dakota and I guess my first question is before you final the eea for the update to the management plan for our lottie's on the grasslands in North Dakota you're going to be back in North Dakota we'd certainly like to see again any chance you'll be back the senator I had a look at my schedule I'd appreciate the times that I've been able to be up there with you and then also the time I've worked up there in the past and them those meetings I've felt have always been real helpful to not only fell for me to understand continue to understand the issues but also the challenges you're facing up there you've been good about coming I think there's some concerns on the part of our ranchers and grazers as far as your draft da and so both in terms of their input some of the specific recommendations they have an input from north north dakota state university range science i need to understand how you're going to take those comments and concerns into consideration and going from the draft to a final EA and i think it would be good if you're back to talk about that before you final the EA but if we look at the comments from the you know the university along with the comments from everyone else plus the the other science it's available it's all factored into those decisions I understand we made some progress you know and resolving that some of the issues but there still is this concern about the the biological capable areas right as to which areas can actually the grass can actually grow tall enough to have the stubble height that we'd like to see for them some of the upland game species so that's the thing is it's going to continue to look at the science that universities provided in the science that that we have from our scientists the work that's been done with NRCS in the comments you know from that the ranchers that I'm going to remain optimistic that we can find a way through on this because it's there's definitely areas where folks agree that it's biologically capable but there's also some areas where we have this disagreement and a lot of that is something we don't have to continue look out and and and work on I also think there's some flexibility here to be able to look at these areas you know and to be able to go out there and just monitor it too because there's maybe some that it's right on the edge and depending on years it may work it may not but I I'm going to remain optimistic that if we can just reach understand areas we're in agreement and then there is where there's disagreement and then go and take a look at those areas and just see what it'll take for us to be able to reach agreement on that and to be able to tend to monitor it because we're in this for the long term can we look at getting you out to have that discussion with our grazers and the NDSU range scientists and your folks before you wish the final II because I think that'd be a good discussion so that our people can get a sense of where you're going and what that flexibility is before you finally da I'll check to see what the schedule is on completing that EA and in my my schedule if there's any way I can get up there I'll do it okay let's see if we can make that happen it'd be great I think it'd be helpful the other is uncontrolled burns what measures are you taking to make sure that you're taking proper precautions to coordinate with people on the ground who live work ranch graze farm in the area before you're doing any controlled burns on forest lands well it's essential that we before we even plan to do a prescribed burn that we not only go through our public comment process but we're also taking the time to meet with our co-operators to meet with the community so that folks understand what we're trying to get down here factor in their concerns you know make sure we're using all the information that we need to have to ensure that when we wear our in prescription to be able to carry out the burn under the conditions where it can be controlled that we have all all the information it's needed in your case that also may need that we need additional weather information and if we're relying it on it from one on one state or one area we may have to recognize we need additional information and if that means putting up some portable weather ahead of time that's the sort of thing we need to do to make sure that we can continue to use the tool but at the same time to do everything we can to make sure that we do not have the situation we have a fire a burn a prescribed burn that it gets out a prescription and impacts you know private land destroys facilities it's the last thing we want to do yeah again I'd really urge you to emphasize to your people that are out in the ground that Local Coordination working with those folks I understand there may be different considerations when you're actually working in forests but we are grasslands that is different and so anything and everything you can do to coordinate with the locals I think is very important

senator rand paul objecting to impeachment today calling the looming trial an unconstitutional sham he joins us right now senator it's good to see you tonight thanks very much for joining us and we know that the senate has voted 45 to 45 to set aside your point of order that impeachment is unconstitutional tell us about it well we put forward a motion that said that basically you can't impeach a private individual you can impeach a president but this is why the chief justice didn't show up if it was the president the chief justice shows up the fact that the chief justice wouldn't come and refuse to come means that this is a private citizen but the constitution doesn't allow for impeachment of a private citizen so we put this issue forward but the most important takeaway from the issue is they don't have the votes to convict we had 45 people 45 republican senators say that the whole the whole charade is unconstitutional so what does that mean it means that impeachment the trial is dead on arrival there there will be a show there will be a parade of partisanship but the democrats really will not be able to win they will be able to play a partisan game that they wish to play but it's all over the this shows that they don't have the votes to win so they will just slog through this and they will try to punish republicans but that's all this has ever been about not justice it's about a partisan game where they don't want the election to be over a partisan game but is it also about stopping donald trump from doing anything in the future i mean the other day eric swalwell said something like we must ensure that donald trump could never do this again i wonder if he told his chinese spy girlfriend that before he stole the rest of us here's the thing about this they want to say that he incited violence because he said go fight for your country and he said march peacefully and patriotically so what i put forward in my arguments today were three instances where democrat words appear to have incited violence you remember the democrats said that the republican plan for health care back when we were debating obamacare they said it was get sick and then you die well can you imagine having a sick child that may be dying and you're told that the republicans want your child to die that sounds an incitement to violence and guess what one of bernie sanders supporters came to the ball field nearly killed steve scalise wounded three or four others shot one of the staff members 10 feet from me and spewed 200 bullets and would have killed more had the police not stopped him but nobody talked about impeaching bernie sanders maxine waters has said get up in their face so was cory booker become a mob we want you to mob them in restaurants and cause mayhem that sounds like an incitement to violence but nobody's talking about impeaching maxine waters nobody's talking about impeaching bernie sanders or cory booker for saying get up in their face so it's all it's a significant hypocrisy and double standard that they're putting forward and they should be called out on it we should not be shy about calling them out about their hypocrisy by the way let's not forget the summer of love in 2020 senator when we had molotov cocktails being thrown in the faces of police where we couldn't get anywhere near the chop zone in seattle and all small businesses in our big cities had to board up i don't remember hearing a peep from any of your colleagues on the left in the summer of love and i reminded them of that as well but the thing is none of them are responding to this at all and i think we caught them flat footed i didn't think they realized that the vote we took today is essentially a mirror of the vote we will take at the very end so we've had a preliminary vote that shows that 45 republicans don't even think the procedure don't even think that the trial is constitutional and so that shows you they are not going to win this is a partisan thing that they want to put forward but i don't think if it is even good for them the president biden says he wants to show unifying he wants to unify the country and yet what he's putting forward is one of the most divisive partisan rancorous bitterest things that you could possibly do and if biden had been a statesman he could have stepped up a week or two ago and said you know i think you know he's being published by public opinion former president trump and i think we should not do the impeachment it won't could be good for the country you know what biden's numbers would have shot up 20 points and people say oh my goodness for once somebody can rise against partisanship but biden didn't show the strength of character to do that he went along with the left-wing radicals and he's going to go along with the impeachment but it's a it's a farce and it's not constitutional and it shows the double standard because democrats have had much hateful speech much more specifically invited inciting violence and nobody said a peep about it and and is he standing by and allowing this black listing to continue and allowing this crushing of free speech and these x's on on trump associates backs you've got democrat stephanie murphy right now pushing legislation to ban anybody who participated in stop the steal and anybody who pushed back on the irregularities in the election 2020 from holding a security clearance or joining the military we have to be very careful about when they start talking about domestic terrorism the last time we did this was the patriot act and they said oh we're only going to spy on foreigners but it turns out they were spying on every american they were they were cataloging every american's phone call so now when they say domestic terrorists you have to realize see i've been willing to say there was fraud in the election i don't know if it was enough fraud because i don't think we did enough investigation as to whether it would have overturned the election i'm agnostic but we should investigate it we should want to know and so i plan on going to 35 40 state legislatures and trying to get them to fix their laws but is that now something that i'm not allowed to say and that i will be wanted by authorities or by the domestic terrorism police because i might say oh my goodness i think somebody might have stole the election i think there might have been fraud so is it is it not okay to have an opinion in our country anymore this started with the global warming extremists now it's gone to election fraud what is the next subject where you're not allowed to have an opinion that contradicts the liberals well i can tell you right now uh you know president biden did another executive order today and in that order he is banning the term china virus have you ever heard anything so ridiculous and extraordinary meanwhile i mean seriously this is this is actually this is happening yeah i i was joking earlier with somebody because you know katie kirk's been talking about sending us all to a deprogramming camp and it's like well at least we'll have katie carrick's katie couric's beautiful smile there while they're before they shock you and give you the soma to try to get you to believe what they believe it's like these people don't realize what they're saying that they they that there has to be this one group think sort of uh position and if you're outside that position you need to be deprogrammed it it is bizarre that people liberal is supposed to mean open-minded that you would hear other opinions it's it's it's more closed-minded than anything i could have ever imagined well they've been telling us that they're tolerant for years so we'll just keep watching if if it weren't so extraordinary and scary it actually would be funny but it is so dangerous and scary senator it's good to see you tonight thanks very much we'll keep following all of your moves thank you sir

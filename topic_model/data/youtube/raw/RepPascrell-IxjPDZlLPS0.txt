yes sir uh senator congressman on cuba two questions if you don't mind one um what is the likelihood that congress will act on whatever aspects of the embargo they have to act on exclusively in order to take the next step after the president's announcement yesterday and also what implications there may be for joanne chesemart and others in her similar situation well with reference to uh the elements of u.s law that i helped write and that are codified when i was in the house of representatives i honestly do not see the incoming congress at this point in time changing u.s law because many of us believe that we had a one-way deal we saw nothing in return human rights activists and political dissidents inside of cuba some who have gotten messages to me and said what did we get what's their ability to peacefully protest in their country and not be arrested and beaten as they are now what freedom do they have to choose their own leaders what freedom do they have to assemble peacefully to try to protest with their government what do the ladies in white which are a group of women who every sunday get dressed in white with a gladiola and march peacefully to church because they protest that their sons and husbands are in jail simply because of their political views and are beaten savagely by the regime what will happen this sunday and every sunday after that when people are not watching so uh from my perspective i see no uh shifting of the of the law certainly not at this time as it relates to joanne chesemart i cannot believe that if this is the deal that the president struck where he basically gave it all that we could not get someone who killed a new jersey state trooper back as part of that deal that's one of the reasons cuba is on the state lists of terrorism sponsors because they harbor joanne chesemart and the last time i asked the fbi over 50 other fugitives from the united states who fled to cuba as their sanctuary joanne chesmar needs to be brought back to justice in new jersey she needs to be held accountable for the death of werner forrester that family has suffered too long and lastly why would we ultimately give up someone who was convicted in the united states convicted in the united states in a federal court in a federal trial with defense with all the elements of american justice convicted of conspiracy to commit murder which led that information of that spy led to the loss of three american citizens who were shot down in civilian flights in international airspace by the cuban regime so we're given that back but we can't get joanne chesemart that is unconscionable and so i am sure that as i hear the president say that he has instructed the secretary of state to look at reviewing whether cuba should be on the state list of terrorism i'm going to drive this incredibly hard because until joanne chesmar comes back not only should cubanot be off the list of terrorism because of that and 50 other felons but at the same time cuba had the largest single violation in the world in recent history of u.n security council resolutions when it's stuck in its freighter a mig and missiles being sent to north korea now that is amazing that a country that violates u.n security council resolutions basically and and clearly has the intent to help north korea which is a national security threat to the united states interests ultimately we would take them off the list of terrorism so joanne chesemart north korea violation 50 felons and the list goes on i'm going to fight that tooth and nail until we bring her back until we do justice at the end of the day let me say this i agree uh with senator menendez i talk to him frequently about cuban affairs my votes are pretty similar that we've had since i've been in the house of representatives i slightly part from him on there had to be a first step and while she has to come back here she has been tried and convicted and she had killed a brave state trooper and she must serve her sentence i know she's been there quite some time now but she must serve her sentence we will accept nothing less until that is done than all the other things uh have to fall in place but that has to be uh a priority as far as i'm concerned i know bob has stated that very carefully it's a very you know 50 years uh i feel that the policy has not worked of embargo uh on the other hand i don't believe that power should be should be changed until there's freedom to assemble in cuba and to speak your mind i don't see that happening tomorrow morning and that would be one that would be one one of the conditions that i would look at because we fall into a trap here i think china and russia have violated the very things that bob and i have been talking about and yet we recognize them as nations we don't call china or russia terrorist countries and yet i have a whole litany of concerns that i have about both of those countries and what gone going right now with russia and i know the center feels as strongly as i do about what russia has done in ukraine that is preposterous it is unacceptable so on one hand we must hold cuba up to a standard well we must hold other countries up to standards as well so we're a little bit consistent anyway i know we're human beings and we're not very consistent but i think that's important to me so i see this as a first step only and where the congress is not going to vote positively on any of this until we are assured tangible evidence is existing that cuba is changing not just by mouth but by deed it's easy to talk about it it's got to be done and i have not seen good faith on the part of the cuban government yet certainly this exchange uh is something that we need to look at and we thank the pope for his involvement uh i i don't bring his name into it to cast a halo over my head or bob's but the fact of the matter is the pope was very concerned about the situation his involvement very early when he became the pope is very interesting this is a different kind of pope he's outreaching he's sticking his nose into things and that's great for the world but that doesn't mean we have to surrender our values and we will not let me uh since bill raised something let me just make it clear from my view number one is i'm consistent i don't know whether our policies are consistent but i'm consistent i did not support most favored nation trading centers was china i did not support that status with vietnam because for me there's a fundamental principle what does america stand for is a beacon of light to people throughout the world and i can tell you as someone who has traveled throughout the world over the last 22 years and certainly in the last two years as the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee it's about democracy it's about human rights it's about the very fundamental things that we take for granted in the united states that people desire so strongly it's about being able to choose who governs you and being able as americans are protesting across this country right now because they feel that the system of justice is not necessarily providing justice to be able to do so without unreasonable and unlawful arrests it is about being able to worship at the altar that you choose it is about being able with the sweat of your own personal effort to achieve goals so i'm consistent i'm consistent on china because i listen after what nearly 50 years with china what do we have forced abortions prison camp labor child labor ethnic cleansing in tibet exile of the dalai lama tiananmen square and i can go on and on hacking into the united states of critical elements in vietnam i had the president of vietnam come visit the senate foreign relations committee and when it came time to talk about human rights and democracy he got up and left the meeting so i am consistent because i believe that america stands for a fundamental principle an idea and an ideal that is uniquely american when we talk about american exceptionalism this is at the core of american exceptionalism so uh this is beyond cuba for me it's about are we going to stand for the principles of democracy and human rights and are we going to stand for them by action not just by words the foreign anybody committee and the fact that you came within a few months of being born in cuba yourself you were not consulted by the administration at all no what does that say about the way president obama is conducting foreign policy well it's it seems uh it seems pretty uh amazing to me that as it relates to global questions there are different people in the congress who have different expertise some of them dedicated a good part of their life in different parts of the world certainly by by virtue of uh my family i have focused on the question of cuba before i ever came to the united states congress for 22 years i focused on the question of iran when no one was paying attention to iran and as a member of the house foreign affairs committee i found out that iran was achieving getting u.s voluntary contributions to the international atomic energy administration beyond our membership dues to do what to create operational capacity of the bushier nuclear facility not in the national interest of the united states not in the national security of the united states certainly not in the national interest and security of the ally the state of israel and i led a successful drive i mentioned that because in some places there are those of us who have spent a very long time looking at the facts looking at the policies looking at the realities of these countries not as we wish them to be but as they are and understanding as they are how do you try to deal with them to change them in the course of action in this respect i must say that at many times the administration is rather insular in not reaching out to those who have a good deal of knowledge and expertise in various areas that could help them at least inform them and you know i've always view that as i have said to the administration many times there is a difference between notification and consultation consultation means you say to me i'm thinking about doing x y or z what do you think if i were to do that how should i do it what do you think we could achieve the best out of it uh and that's consultation notification is when you get a call and you say we're going to do the following things tomorrow senator congressman among the tax measures that you all dealt with was the real commuter attacks uh to understand it i mean if it's going to be done or expire at the end of the year would that mean what the followers uh people who could claim this they wouldn't be able to claim this uh 250 uh credit in this coming taxi well that's in that was in the budget you're talking about taxes in the tax tax measures that you all just uh i voted no for a lot of reasons which i expressed at the time and if i had to do it over again i would have vote no twice so what what are you asking me a lot of good stuff a lot of good stuff in there let me let me join bill look there's a provision that i've argued for along with senator schumer uh which is to give equal equity to transit riders as we already have permanently in the code to those who use their car and get a deduction to go to work and do business well transit riders who have to go to work as well should get a deduction a credit as well now unfortunately as a member of the senate finance committee we passed a two-year bill i'd like to see some of these elements i think this is a good public policy that makes a lot of sense gets people to work get sales forces to work does it in a way that pollutes the environment a lot less and ultimately spends a lot less time in traffic so there's a whole host of public policy reasons why it should be permanent but we cannot get our republican colleagues to agree to that so we asked for a two-year bill so that at least people could prospectively think about what are the tax consequences in this case and in others unfortunately we could not get the republicans to agree to a two-year bill so the nature of your specific question leon is that in fact the time frame to get the benefit of the commuter credit is very limited and we are working to try to get a determination that it can be at least retroactive and of course part of that is proof points but so we're working to try to make that happen and i hope it will but this is a perfect example of why short-term tax bills at the end of a calendar year make no sense in terms of public policy yeah actually the tax bill lasts for two weeks because we already finished the year it is full baloney total baloney that's what it was no but the money had already been spent which makes it even more hypocritical and we're going to do the same thing in 2015. that's our tax bill and i will not vote for that it's a charade period i will not vote for that bob you have last question um senator and congressman there are a lot of organizations inside the jewish community in new jersey and elsewhere that have close relationships with cuba particularly the jews of cuba they're anxious for for more loosening of the restrictions how do you what do you say to them do you have any i mean what is your answer first of all there's no one in the united states senate who has a stronger record about the u.s israel relationship and my support of the community but i would say they're dead wrong they're dead wrong for the following reason smoking a cigar made by hands that don't get paid a wage directly but are in essence slave labor and sending yourself in varadero and having a cuba libre which is an oxymoron does not liberate the people of cuba now nurturing the jewish community or any other community of faith in the country is always a positive thing and i actually was the one who got a special license notwithstanding our law so that a group of jewish americans could help rebuild the synagogue in havana that's a good thing but i've got to be honest with you i see a lot of these trips and there's a day or two of the community and the rest of the time we're on the beach well being on the beach doesn't liberate the cuban people going to a hotel that is co-owned by the state and co-owned by the military doesn't free the cuban people a hotel which until just very recently a cuban could not even go into in his own country so uh i would say to my friends in the community all for nurturing the jewish community in havana but i have to be honest with you just as i promote freedom and democracy and israel's security and its right to be sovereign and secure i would hope that the community would not only nurture the community in havana but be voices of democracy and human rights when people go to cuba why don't they meet with human rights activists with political dissidents with independent journalists who are struggling inside of a tyranny to be able to enjoy what we are enjoying here today but no that doesn't happen so there has to be some consciousness here and some responsibility as well if we are going to change the course of events in a real meaningful way thank you

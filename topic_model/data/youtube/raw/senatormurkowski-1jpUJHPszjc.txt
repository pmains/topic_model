thank you madam president i'm here on the floor today to make what i consider to be a super cool announcement and i think my colleagues know well that i am a fan of the last great race the iditarod and i am shameless in my promotion of not only the exceptional athleticism of the mushers themselves but the canine athletes and madam president as a as an athlete yourself i think you can appreciate the endurance training that uh that it takes to be a a qualified and truly an exceptional athlete and and today we're able to to celebrate an extraordinary musher and an extraordinary team it was just a little over a week ago last sunday morning that well actually it was saturday that i was in anchorage for the ceremonial start of the iditarod it takes place downtown in anchorage we have to truck snow in we close off all the downtown streets not too many cities actually bring the snow in but we brought the snow in dumped it around the street close the streets mushers come to to town from all over the state 49 mushers this year they bring their sled dogs in along the sides of the shoots are thousands of of alaskans and thousands of visitors the people who come from around the country and around the world to to launch these these extraordinary teams down the street everybody all bundled up it was one of those days that was just picture perfect for the start of an iditarod it was big huge snowflakes coming down making everything white the dogs are jumping in their traces just straight up just bouncing up with excitement and the yipping and the howling was just it was it was excitement that was contagious and to be out there in the shoots wishing the racers luck cheering them on before they embark on their thousand mile journey to the north it's an experience that i would encourage anyone whether you are a canine lover or not those of you who understand the value of working dogs and what they mean and how how they they love to do what they do the iditarod is an experience like none other this was the 50th anniversary for 50 years now the iditarod has been going from from south central in the in the willow area all the way up to nome again 49 teams entered these these mushers face some pretty challenging conditions you're going over terrain that is mountain range and down into to to gorges you are on flat glare ice going across norton sound howling winds driving driving snow it is it is a mental task it is a physical task and um and and truly one of endurance keep in mind keep in mind that most are thinking wait this is alaska in the winter time it's cold um but in fairness the teams actually prefer to be running at night when the temperatures are cooler so they're running truly based on the dog's schedule the endurance but but not necessarily in the tamist of of conditions this is this is not only a race where we celebrate the the musher and their teams but we also celebrate the volunteer spirit that comes with this this is an extraordinary race over a thousand miles going through some of the most extreme wilderness that you will encounter and then occasionally along the way small villages that are used as as checkpoints or opportunities for the many volunteers to basically gather there's about 1500 people who volunteered to put this race on so those who set the trail markers who set out there with with their snow machines to to mark that trail it's nothing more than like a a wood marker that you would get at home depot or lowe's with a little painted orange on it that's the sophistication of this this is what guides the team and blazing in a blizzard but the veterinarians that are there four to five vets cycle through each checkpoint because each dog needs to be checked every time they go through their checkpoint all these folks come from all around the country to volunteer they pay for their flights up they take a week off work and they're there they're there to support not only the race but they're there to support gold standard canine care and and so it is it's also a celebration about the volunteers this is this is such a great part of our of our state's heritage our culture again you can tell i get a little enthusiastic about even my necklace madam president is is a dog sled with a musher on it so this is the time of year that i like to celebrate it so this morning at 5 39 a.m alaska standard time so about 11 30 here in d.c eight days 14 hours 38 minutes since beginning a roughly thousand mile race brent sass and his team of 11 dogs crossed the finish line so here's brent with his two dogs yellow roses flown in from don't know where those yellow roses came from but they certainly weren't from nome alaska but that man has has traveled with his team for for eight days now 14 hours 38 minutes to win the 50th iditarod i had a chance to talk to brent by phone just about an hour after he he went into gnome he sounded pretty pretty vibrant pretty excited pretty happy i had talked to him in the starting gate on saturday and i said brent i think this is your time i think this is your time because you have proved yourself year over year in the iditarod and certainly in the yukon quest brandt lives in eureka alaska on a homestead that was established back in the 70s he's a pretty seasoned musher he took part in his first iditarod back in 2012 he got rookie of the year that year he's a three-time yukon quest champion so the yukon quest runs a different race it's from from canada into alaska it is also a thousand-mile race it is equally arduous and extraordinarily difficult he took first place in the yukon quest in 2015 2019 and 2020. so a couple little quick stories here madam president because i know i don't have much time but this guy is pretty exceptional he's not only a strong competitor but the care that he provides his dogs is amazing one story from 2016 brent was getting ready to leave the white mountain checkpoint it's about 77 miles from the finish line in gnome he was teed up here to win third place and depending on where you are in the rank is how much of the purse you will take home and if he was going to make 30 it was going to be at about a 44 000 prize money but he's getting ready to leave the checkpoint and his dogs said nope we're not moving so think about it you're that close to 44 thousand dollars you're 77 miles from the finish and your dogs have said this has been a long trek and this is where we're stopping to just rest so brent sass didn't push those dogs he waited as they rested and when they were ready he took it slow he took it steady brought them to the finish line he ended up placing 20th instead of the third and he did that for his team and for that he was recognized twice with the vets choice award for the care that he showed his dogs but it's not just it's not just his team that brent is known for taking care of he's also known for taking care of his competitors along the trail there was a headline a few years back that said sas to the rescue again and time after time brent has been highlighted for acts of heroism on the trail in vicious storms he's helped mushers and their dog teams reunite after becoming separated on the trail and keep in mind there's no rescue team out there it's you and if you're lucky enough to have somebody else come upon you fortunately but during one race a fellow musher was at risk for scratching the race and instead of leaving him behind as many competitors might have done brent helped him scale eagle summit so he could stay in the race but one of the most notable rescues took place in 2011 on the trail of the yukon quest hans got he was a four-time champion he was stalled out he wasn't able to clear the summit the weather conditions were awful so hans did the only thing that he could do which is to hunker down into a sleeping bag in these horrible winds the driving cold snow brent sled comes upon hans sees that he's on the verge of hypothermia he hooks his sled to the back of his own and he hauls both teams up over the summit and brent credits his then lead dog silver for guiding them to safety in these awful and harsh conditions and a result of their teamwork and heroism the quest created the silver legacy award in silver's honor brent claims that to be one of the proudest moments of his life i wish that i could have been there this morning at 5 39 in gnome to watch brent cross the finish line as as a first time iditarod champ with his team but but even from afar we can we can hear the alaskans celebrating brent for his incredible feat so to brent sass we celebrate you we thank you for the care that you show your dog team your character how you show uh what it means to be a true competitor and for representing the great state of alaska so well and all the others that are still on the trail we wish you well and safety and godspeed with that mr president i yield the floor

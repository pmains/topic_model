speaker I proudly supported this bill when we marked it in the intelligence community I'm only bringing up this amendment madam Speaker today to address a basic transparency concern raised by my constituents after the markup the cybersecurity threat polls to our government our businesses and our personal information is massive and growing every day this bill provides important tools to ensure that the lessons learned from a breach of one company can help strengthen the security of others as a result your social security and credit card numbers will be better protected and the speaker is someone who opposed sistah last year I feel like this iteration is a major first step forward in privacy protection and transparency I am particularly happy with the robust protections of personally identifiable information unlike past iterations this bill mandates that cyber threat information is scanned and personal information is removed not once but twice before it can be transmitted to other federal agencies and please madam Speaker that companies will share their cyber threat information with a civilian agency not directly with the intelligence community I'm also happy that additional limitations are placed on the ways that cyber threat information can be utilized and yet for all the benefits of this bill of the American people still rightfully so expect oversight that is consistent and comprehensive that is what this amendment is all about it strengthens the oversight of the inspector general monitoring this if this kind of information sharing now with this amendment the inspector general will oversee and report on the process for information sharing procedures for removing personal information and any incidents in which this information was treated improperly it will ensure Congress and the public that sharing is happening properly and the public is being protected I hope that my good Republican colleagues can support this amendment and I reserve the balance of my time the gentleman from Indiana reserves for what purpose

mr. speaker as a member of the labor HHS and state and foreign operations subcommittees I rise today in strong opposition to HR 52-43 which is the so-called Zika funding bill earlier this week the majority finally decided to act on Zika yet their proposals shows just how unwilling they are to take this crisis seriously even now they've offered barely one-third of the resources need to fight Zika not only are my Republican colleagues efforts three months late they're also woefully inadequate to address this major public health emergency and if that weren't enough Republicans at once again included poison pills that have no place in this legislation while we are trying to work to protect our nation's most vulnerable including pregnant women and their children the majority is putting politics over public health and that is just wrong the Zika outbreak has already spread to more than 26 countries including in the United States and our territories sarat sadly there have been two Zika deaths in Puerto Rico this summer Americans living in southern states face tremendous risks from the virus not only does this bill under fun hours eco response it raids vital funding for other dangerous infectious diseases such as Ebola because we should not roll the dice it should another Ebola outbreak occur and we know how this appropriations process works I don't want to chance that we appropriated Ebola funding for Ebola this is not the time to rob Peter to pay Paul the experts are clear we need the full 1.9 billion request emergency request without offsets but we've seen war funding emergency supplementals flying through this house without many questions raised this is an emergency and we need to treat it as such and finally this bill includes hide like language a dangerous rider that denies access to abortion coverage for women because if they're poor a veteran and the military or federal government employee let me be clear politicians have no business denying women's health coverage based on her income her employer or her zip code but once again the majority has decided to put their extremist ideology over public health now why in the world would they put this writer in this Zika funding build it doesn't make any sense and it's wrong it's been three months since the world health organization declared zika virus as a public health emergency that was February three months since the president requested emergency funds the time to act is now Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote to reject this bill and let's instead pass a bill with adequate funding and without ideological anti women writers the American people can't afford to wait much longer for Congress to get

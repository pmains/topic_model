from Florida mr. Posey thank you madam Speaker and thank the gentleman for yielding we want America back those are just a few of the lyrics of a song written by a group named steals in 1996 some of them said something is wrong with America this nation is like a runaway train headed down the wrong track and it concludes in part with I love America but I don't love what she's becoming circumstances seem pretty despairing back then but they pale in comparison to what we're seeing going on across our country today perpetrated by Marxist anarchists and those malcontent who are funding them today the miscreants are using George Chloe's death to nude the ability of the police to enforce the law and so far they've been successful in getting the police out of the way without law enforcement their mobs are free to move in smash businesses injure people and cause chaos those aren't people those aren't peaceful protesters and they're not people peaceful protest their outcry for justice makes sympathetic or perhaps even cowardly corporations and stupid movie stars send money to them now they're tearing down the statues intimidating the public and politicians into accepting there are far-fetched demands and giving them even more power circumstances are advantageous for them right now because we're in the midst of a pandemic so they have a freer reign of the streets who could have ever imagined sanctuary cities where America's rural law is willfully ignored by government officials who would have ever imagined some elected officials would allow domestic terrorists or wannabe revolutionaries to commandeer a complete takeover and rule of both public and private property and have dominion over other unwilling citizens of the United States in so-called autonomous zones give me a break and then the lawbreakers have the audacity to demand our police be defunded or reimagined whatever the heck that means it sounds insane it's really a campaign to drive our duly elected president Donald Trump from office anyone who stands in their way they think should be destroyed and so we can expect it to get worse and worse until November the third when they hope to put an end to the prosperity created by the president you'd have to suffer from the world's worst case of Potomac fever or beltway brain drain to think they are fooling anybody meanwhile the leadership and majority in this chamber have been silent I've not heard a single word syllable or letter uttered by them in opposition to the miscreants it's past time for them to condemn their activities and it's time for law enforcement across this nation in every state in every county in every city in every little little burg community and the rural areas in between to put an end to this lawlessness if you don't start acting soon there won't be anything left to tear down I'd like to take a bunch of these want to be revolutionaries to South or Central America for a few days to see how their game would end if they were successful in having it their way if you've ever traveled throughout those socialist countries there it's a very eye-opening experience the State Department and even their own officials warned you don't wear any jewelry don't carry much cash because there's a good chance you're going to get robbed and if you're approached by a robber hand over everything hold back nothing because they would just as soon shoot you and kill you that's not shoot you and kill you there's a lot of onus and they don't fear justice they don't fear the police they're gonna take and you're gonna give or you're gonna die and you know what the State Department and the local officials tell you next if you get robbed don't call the police it's not like in our country where if there's a problem you call the police there they tell you not to call the police because they're all corrupt and they'll shake you down for anything the robbers missed one common denominator of the countries that that I visited which were Brazil French Guiana Suriname and Trinidad was a common denominator that every single house that I saw larger small urban or suburban no matter how far out you went into the country every single house that was more than a cardboard box had bars on every window and most of the doors why because that's what lawlessness brings they truly go to bed every night in those socialist countries with the expectation that if they did not have bars they wouldn't wake up in the morning or if they did every possession that they had that was worth anything would be going very little police high crime high unemployment bars and all the windows is that what we really want for our future we've been blessed to live in a land of opportunity the most free and prosperous nation in the history of the world many many many people have risked their lives and the lives of their wives their grandparents their parents their children family members to come here this place is really that good that people would risk their life just to come here at a chance of coming here we cannot stand back and let it be destroyed we want America back and I yield back thank you thank you Jim

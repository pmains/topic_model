was so excuse me um so we have a um people are allowed in this thing um so we have been working on uh mindfulness-based techniques um throughout education healthcare but one of the focuses uh for our office and the caucus has been uh mental health and military mental health so this uh panel that we have today i'm very excited um to listen um just a couple of things that are that's happening there's a program that is a training program right now the marines are very very excited about the army uh is also excited about that is a uh the mind fitness institute is running and it's a mindfulness-based mental fitness training and we've had several exchanges with general amos general dunford now who's now back in the middle east are very high on this particular training because it helps the soldiers build their own resiliency um and you'll hear more of this from the from the panelists but almost an inoculation for post-traumatic stress that is the the hope and we're also seeing benefits on the backside with veterans with this particular program it's not necessarily designed for that but i've talked to many soldiers who are getting trained in in this program and they're starting to sleep through the nights they're getting off their medication a lot of very positive benefits with the mindfulness-based practice there's another program called integrative i know i know it is irest the official name is integrative restoration and it's uh it's a yogic deep yogic breathing and some meditation having very similar effects there in vas around the country another uh program is called project welcome home troops which is something very similar a lot of deep breathing helping process a lot of the trauma that a lot of our soldiers carry uh in their body so we're looking for alternative techniques that can help these uh soldiers and um we have met more than one who has benefited from this i went to the laba they're doing some amazing innovative things where i've met vietnam vets who started to go through whether it was eye rest or mindfulness or whatever and say things like um i don't think about killing myself every day anymore since i've been doing this program or i'm off my meds i'm sleeping through the night and another vietnam vet said which was really inspirational for me said we have to get out and we have to tell these iraq and afghanistan veterans that they don't have to wait 40 years before they find something that can help them deal with what they need to deal with so that's why i'm motivated and scott annie and my staff are motivated to try to continue to get this word out because it's working there aren't any side effects to what we're promoting but we do have to get the word out so i'm very thankful that the panel is here just fyi we do a weekly through the addiction treatment and recovery caucus and i'm also a co-chair we do a weekly meditation group that we've had up to 30 staffers in bolton and some members and that is going to be friday at 9 30 canon 121. i'm just a mouth piece so if you if you want to try it and see what it's like it's one thing to read about it but to sit for 15 20 or 30 minutes and have it's a nice little down time in the week as well but see what we're doing um next week andrew while we'll be here um who's a big integrative uh healthcare specialist he's coming to to do one of these events for us so anyway let me get to our panel here so first dr sonja batten so thank you so much dr batten she serves it in a leadership role for the office of mental health services at the va central office as the deputy chief consultant for specialty mental health she oversees va's collaborations with the department of defense on mental health issues serves as the primary liaison for va specialized mental health centers of excellence throughout her career dr batten has developed multiple outpatient and residential treatment programs for veterans of all uh areas of service living with post-traumatic stress so very much for rave reviews thank you dr batten um so next is retired general tom jones with the marine corps was the founding commander of the training and education command responsible for the marine corps instituting the martial arts and he helped the marine corps develop operational stress control and readiness training program he's been asked by senior marine corps leaders to study liz stanley's program the one that i mentioned the mind training institute is implementing and make recommendations on how to incorporate it into united states marine corps training and has become a student of her practice as well and frank d giovanni sorry i walked up to frank and the first thing i said is frank i'm half italian so let's talk um frank di giovanni serves as the director of training readiness and strategy office of the deputy assistant secretary of defense for readiness his responsibilities include policy and oversight of military training readiness and capability modernization mr d giovanni retired from the air force achieving the rank of colonel with senior pilot and navigator aeronautical ratings aircraft flown include the f-15 a37 and b-52 lots of mindfulness needed is flying those aircraft thank you i'm excited to have the opportunity to um to speak to you all today and what i'm going to focus on some from the department of veterans affairs and i'm going to focus on just telling you a little bit about what we're doing with mindfulness-based treatments and interventions throughout va and some of how we're also focusing on studying these interventions so we can learn more about how effective they are for whom they're most effective in in what sort of settings so i'll probably focus more on ptsd than anything else but certainly we use mindfulness-based treatments for a variety of mental health conditions throughout va and um and really when we're talking about um things like post-traumatic stress disorder you know our philosophy is that um that all veterans should be offered as their their sort of first line first opportunity for mental health treatment they should be offered those treatments that have the most empirical evidence behind them so just like if you were coming to a medical center for heart disease or diabetes you would want to receive the treatment that had the most research behind it to show that it was the most effective and so i want to start off by just putting in context that for example for post-traumatic stress disorder what the research shows us is that the most effective treatments are cognitive behavioral therapies so those are talk therapies where individuals are encouraged to talk about the traumatic event that they've been through to talk about some of the thoughts that they have about what it means to them that they experience that event and how it's influenced their sort of views on themselves and others in the world and we have very effective treatments for ptsd that said it's important to realize that that we want to have a range of treatments available because it's not one-size-fits-all and even with our very effective treatments for ptsd they're not universally effective they're not they're not effective for everyone um you know for some clients it's just not the right fit for them it doesn't fit with their way of experiencing the world or what's most helpful for them you know our treatments for ptsd are often exposure-based and that means that we ask people to really talk about the specific trauma that they experienced and well we know that that's very effective not all clients are willing to do that and that's and that's okay that's their choice and so it's important to have alternatives um so that people can um can choose what's right for them or maybe maybe at some point they will be willing to do that but maybe as a first step that's not what they choose to do and we also know that for some of our cognitive behavioral treatments like exposure therapy they work more when the person's problems are anxiety focused so when there's fear and anxiety and then having people approach those things that make them anxious over time what we find is that the anxiety will eventually level off but it doesn't work the same way when we're talking about things like anger or guilt or shame you know we wouldn't necessarily expect sadness or guilt over losing a buddy in battles we wouldn't necessarily expect that to ever go away right and so um so it's important to have multiple models of how we approach these things and we really think that acceptance and mindfulness based treatments allow us to build on the evidence for existing treatments that we have while providing some alternatives for people who may not be willing or may not have benefited from traditional treatments and it allows us to really look at the full continuum of emotional experience so not just anxiety and fear but we can work on acceptance and mindfulness with the whole range of emotional experiences um including shame guilt anger um sadness and those sorts of things um so so it's important just to sort of put it in that context that um that mindfulness and acceptance-based treatments may be a really important tool um and that's what i'll focus on talking about today but it's it's not that to the exclusion of the other things that we know are effective just to talk to you a little bit about what we find in va in terms of complementary and alternative medicine in general a survey that we did a couple of years ago just looking at cam complementary and alternative medicine practices across our va system found that 89 of our va medical centers were using some form of cam treatment for for some problem that the veterans were coming to them for and the top four reasons that cam practices were being used in va were all mental health related so stress management anxiety disorders ptsd and depression so there is a strong interest in using complementary and alternative medicine practices for mental health and in fact we did a survey specifically of our ptsd programs to find out how much our ptsd programs we're incorporating complementary and alternative medicine practices and we found that 75 of our ptsd programs had at least some capability to provide mindfulness-based treatments so this is not something that's new to va this is something that our clinicians are very interested in and have been receiving training in and there are a variety of mindfulness-based treatments that we use for ptsd for depression and for related mental health conditions um and and it's important to realize though that we don't have the strength of scientific evidence for these mindfulness-based practices again as i was saying it's sort of a first-line treatment for things like ptsd and so um while we are providing it to some veterans where it seems clinically indicated and the therapist and the client together have identified that this is the treatment they want to use it's important to realize that we also need to be building the scientific base so that we can understand whether or not these treatments are effective for whom they're effective how much we need to be providing you know how many sessions of mindfulness-based treatment do we need to be providing can we provide it via telehealth or does it have to be in person should it be in group format or individual form there are all sorts of things that we think are important to study so that we can better understand how to use mindfulness-based practices to the highest benefit for our veterans and so actually a couple of years ago we issued a request for proposals through our office of research and development asking for proposals for meditation-based research studies for ptsd and really looking for those high-grade randomized controlled trials where we have a control group and so by the end you can say that that the effect that we see is because um they receive this intervention versus this intervention and so the office of research and development funded three studies um they were all three two year studies so we're about halfway through those uh three two year studies each for about a million dollars and um two of them are looking at mindfulness-based approaches to the treatment of ptsd and one is looking at montreal repetition which is another meditation-based treatment and and so both of those are all three of those studies are in progress and in a year year and a half we should have the results to share so we're very much looking forward to seeing the results of those controlled studies and because we know that this is something that our clinicians have interest in veterans have interest in but we want to make sure that that we're supporting the scientific research base and not just going based on you know our gut instincts that this is helpful for some people we also have a number of what we call demonstration projects or pilot projects across va and so we funded demonstration projects at nine va medical centers around the country again about two years ago and those are looking at a variety of different practices those are not that same sort of scientifically controlled randomized controlled trial but more when you start seeing veterans in routine care we offer them this treatment and then we're studying the outcomes and the acceptability and whether veterans like it you know how both how is it working with respect to their clinical symptoms but also quality of life patient satisfaction things like that so we have nine of those uh studies going on and they're looking at interventions like mindfulness based stress reduction mindfulness-based cognitive therapy montreum repetition transcendental meditation and again they're looking at them in a variety of formats so individual therapy group therapy through telehealth and so we're really excited to be able to get some of the results of those and we hired an independent academic group from the university of rochester to do the evaluation of all of those nine demonstration projects using similar measures and similar processes so that even though they're each looking at a slightly different approach to meditation we hope that we'll have similar enough uh metrics to be able to see what the effect was and so probably toward the end of the calendar year we'll have something that we're able to say about how how those have gone so but in general it's been very well received by the veterans they've really enjoyed it we've not had trouble recruiting people you know people are very interested both the clinicians and and the veterans um and then the last thing that i wanted to talk about was just about two of the sort of uh more standard psychotherapy approaches that we have in va that we have been disseminating and providing training for the largest one is called acceptance and commitment therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy or act is a third wave behavioral treatment that's really focused on recognizing that we all have certain thoughts feelings bodily sensations memories urges that come up for us throughout the day every single day of our lives and the extent to which we try to fight with those try to control those avoid those experiences when that's your characteristic way of dealing with unwanted thoughts feelings memories etc it may work in the short term but over time what the evidence shows us is that avoidance is not a terribly effective way of dealing with our own internal experiences and so acceptance and commitment therapy is based on the premise that we can learn different ways to be in touch with those thoughts feelings memories i know i sound like a shrink but i am so i can't help it um you know that we can learn different ways to to be in touch with those things because if we were going to be able to get rid of them we probably would have figured out how to do that already so instead maybe we can try a different approach and work on accepting and being mindful of what's there and then at the same time you know it's not about just sort of touchy feely get in touch with your emotions and that's good enough it's can we be present with what's there anyway in the service of being able to move forward with our lives and so act is really based on this idea that we work with each individual to identify the directions the values that are important to them in their lives and then how can we help them move forward to live a life that's more meaningful and effective for them even in the presence of those thoughts feelings memories bodily sensations behavioral predispositions etc so that's that's act and act is an evidence-based treatment that's been researched and applied around the world and has been shown to be effective for a variety of problems like depression chronic pain smoking cessation psychotic symptoms a really wide variety of behavioral issues and so in act we have practitioners in all across the country who are doing act but we've done a targeted dissemination of training on act for depression and so at this point we've trained about 480 clinicians around the country and act although there are many others who have been to trainings on their own not not through our dissemination they're in about 75 percent of our medical centers providing act specifically for depression um but many clinicians use it with clients where it's an appropriate sort of clinical intervention for other problems as well and then the second one that's a again probably the next most frequent treatment in rbas that has a mindfulness component is called dialectical behavior therapy and again that's a behavioral therapy that was initially developed by marsha lenahan at the university of washington specifically for individuals who were at chronic high risk of self-injury and so these are individuals who might frequently be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and frequently have a trauma history themselves and so dialectical behavior therapy is again one of these acceptance and mindfulness-based treatments and that really specifically teaches mindfulness skills because for for individuals who are at chronic risk of self-harm and high suicide risk it's often because they sort of get into a moment and are experiencing intense emotions or really difficult thoughts and aren't able to just sit with those and have them present and so often the self-injury is a way to get a try to get away from that moment because they don't know what else to do and so mindfulness can be one of those tools that we teach in order to help people get there be present in the moment and recognize that they can make a variety of choices in order to get through those difficult situations so dbt is something that again we have in many of our trauma recovery programs nationwide but it's not something that we've done a national dissemination of but we're looking right now at doing some pilot projects for dbt and really looking at doing the specifically the teaching the skills that are part of dbt to teams across the country and um and seeing whether or not uh it's effective and how it works with our veteran population in a slightly more um structured way so um so those i think are the the main points that i wanted to to hit for today and i guess we'll do questions and discussion afterwards okay so thank you i'm standing in for dr elizabeth stanley who developed the my business program in fact myself and my staff actually went through about 20 hours of training so i'm a bureaucrat that's what i do for a living but i also write military credit policy so i i was very interested in this class of of training and therefore felt that the best way to understand it was to actually participate in it so so me and my members of my staff were through five hours or actually 20 hours of training over about a six-week period and and i found it to be very very fascinating and extremely useful so i want to talk a little bit about what i learned from that training course how many of you have actually except for the congressman will will exclude you sir how many of you have actually done some my fitness exercises and training okay good so it helped me sarah because i i know that you are definitely knowledgeable in this area but i do want to kind of expose you to why um we are considering writing some new policy which asked the departments the services to look at this class of training so you know as as the congress said i have 26 years in the united states air force and i'm sure my friend general joe was like coveted about that 26 years a fighter pilot farmer pilot um also uh three operational deployments so so i do kind of understand the kind of stress that comes from those types of activities why do i think it's important i think there's a couple of things first of all there's a there's a there's a clip in a movie that dr stanley shows and it said it's it's from saving private ryan and there's a there's a scene in there where it's at the end of the day it's dark they're in a house and there's a fire and tom hanks's hand starts shaking and the sergeant says to him you know you ought to think about a different line of work right because he looked at the hands shaking as weakness there was a problem he wasn't handling the stress so if you understand mind fitness training you'd understand why his hands were shaking how many people know why his hands were shaking because he was afraid the answer is it's a natural reaction of your body to reduce stress so it's actually taking your body down from a very high alerted state and say i have to do something with that energy and so it was dissipating it through a trembling of your hands so the sergeant misinterpreted and in fact inhibited the tom hanks character from relieving stress because they didn't understand what was going on and that's one of the reasons why my fitness training mindfulness training is important because what happened in that particular case and it happens across the department is it was actually accelerating the level of stress in that individual allow it to dissipate so this is something we need to train our people about um i put it into one of courses first so all senior civilians going to afghanistan go through a train course that i manage i put every one of our civilians to this my fitness training because i think it's it helps them with stress i mean you have to maintain yourself in this this kind of this kind of band of allowable stress when you talk to people under high stress here's another example i mean how much does it take for them to get angry with you not much and the reason is because they're operating at this at the very upper limit of what you can accept as being comfortable and it just takes just a little bit to kick you over the top so when you think about people and you certainly know this as well many people who suffer from pts have anger issues and a lot of it is associated with their ability not to understand the stress they've gone under and not being able to regulate that stress which mindfulness training allows you to do even for example olympic shooters when when they get ready to go out and do what they're going to do it's amazing they use mindfulness techniques to focus right because the because what it what it does is it allows you to be in the here and now and focus on whatever the task at hand is so so it was interesting i read an article about how olympic shooters prepare themselves for competition and almost all of them use some form of life in this training so that when they go out and they put a round on target they're absolutely focused on nothing but putting a route to that target why are the one of the reasons one of the reasons why the brains are using it and general jones will talk a little bit to you about that is that if you're on patrol and your mind is daydreaming will you see the threat coming no so the marines are using it as a situational awareness capability to make sure that if you're on patrol that you're focused on what's going on around you at that moment and then if you find yourself wandering off a neuroplastic wrap you force your mind to stop doing dreaming and focus again on what is going on around you so there's there's a lot of reasons other than the stress piece why this is important to the military it has to do with situational awareness it has to do with survival it has to do with identification of threats another quick story that i'll tell you is one of the things that liz stanley tells us to do is when you're like because i said look i don't really have time to do 50 minutes a day you know help me with that and she said well if you're walking to a meeting and all of us in here i mean all of you walk to meetings right and a lot of times you're stressing about the meeting so when you get to the room you're stressed out she said well you know what i think you should do and i go by dina one of the things you should do behind is focus on what your feet feel like in your shoes while you're walking to your next meeting don't get stressed out about what you're going to say what's going to be said to you in the meeting and so i've done that a couple of times it's amazing when i get to the meeting i'll actually relax and i'm ready to do the meeting and i'm not worried about all the stress so try it the next time you're walking between to the to a meeting when you're walking there just focus on what do my feet feel like in my shoes what do my socks feel like what do my calves feel like that gets you back in the hair and not you need to try at the neck contact when you walk back to your offices i encourage you to try it um the other thing is is breaking the chain on pts and again general jones we'll talk to you a little bit about that but another important part of mindfulness training is is not only being able to identify in yourself when you're stressed but helping others to identify when they're after stress so the other thing that liz daley talks about is mirroring which means that if i have a calm demeanor you're going to try to mirror my attitude you're not going to be stressed out you're going to look at me and see my calm demeanor and hopefully you're going to try to mirror what i'm doing rather than stay stressed so you've got to be able to identify not only stressing yourself the stress in others and as a leader you need to be able to to help your soldiers recover from that kind of stress level so i think that's i think that's uh all i want to say except for one other thing and that is i want to tell you what i'm proposing to put in in dod policy so this is a dod instruction department of defense instruction it's called implementing dod training and my office responsible for publishing that document it's a proposal we'll see if it survives but i'll read i'll read what it says it says dod components we'll develop and implement training with the objective of improving mental fitness resiliency and stress control so we'll see we'll see where that takes us i i think i put enough combat boots on the knee to do mindfulness training i mean there are things other than stress that help you be a bet operational be a better operator and operate better continuously before we get general jones you said one phrase that maybe you could just to expound on for a second you said neuroplastic correct yes sir can you explain what that what that means okay so so the other thing that's interesting and i'll just throw this out too there's actually there's actually a commercial product out there offered by a company called luminosity and anybody seen them and it's got a little picture with a little light bulb about the person said and she says i'm exercising my brain so now neuroplastic rep is when um and it's actually a it's actually i won't say it's a physical but it's an exercise for your brain and a neuroplastic breath occurs when i guarantee while i've been talking you all have daydream and i know you have it's it's it's normal human behavior but a neuroplastic rep is when you realize that you have daydream and you mentally force your mind back to focus on the hair and now and every time you do that it's called a neuroplastic rep and it's also helping the circuits in your brain stay wired so the other thing that metal fit that mind fitness does is it it helps with cognition it helps to keep your mic clear it helps you develop neural pathways that allow you to focus better so that so that that neuroplastic wrap is actually the development of a neural pathway that that unclutters your mind which is why the luminosity people talk about neuroplastic reps and and helping themselves think better okay he warned him in the military they went to the air force instead i have no expertise in mental health what i've got a lot of experience doing with warriors movement struggling with donald trump uh how i got started this i started a camp for kids a number of years ago before i even retired from green war they've been working towards working with atlas kids since i had this campus high venture camp in pennsylvania i started doing sessions week-long sessions with warriors who were struggling with a lot of things i guess a predominant thing was with mental health issues i got pulled into the middle of the arena when when we uh when i had some mental health professionals dr nash who's a renowned psychiatrist who attends every one of our sessions pulled me in about four years ago in fact the project i'm working on now has a larger portfolio than than the marine corps and it's sponsored by d unionized office at the pentagon i've known dni for a number of years i went to him because i was working on some some projects for the marines in the army for iraq and afghanistan and i explained to him that we got a real problem now with the mental health issues we got a real problem with the covenant of trust with clinicians and the warrior they aren't divulging to the to the clinician the uh really the stressor that created the problem to begin with and so we so we worked on these uh seminars relative to building a team concept around the warrior so he or she would then be more apt to share with the physician being a psychologist like our psychiatrist so you know the nature of their problems when we started this project we started looking at his his mandate to me was look at anything and everything that represented best practices but look as we look through i want you to do a research i want you to look at things from a from a marine's perspective of things that would in fact work a lot of things might work in a in in a clinic but they may not work in an organization like the like the army of the marine corps so i spent time with prolonged exposure therapy with uh skip rezo and virtual iraq and virtual cast and cognitive processing therapy all these things are looking at and so what we're trying to do is identify those things that we would work well we got into ires about three years ago and this is just anecdotal but a lot of success not only with people with stress injuries but people with stress already been diagnosed with ptsd a common effect increasing their sleep habits and patterns and whatnot and a lot of progress um about a year and a half ago i first learned of mindfulness and talking to dunford he general government spent time with stanley and uh i started watching uh mindfulness and i spent time at the naval health research center in in san diego and we started looking through a third trials and some of their stuff is pretty compelling and it's pretty compelling for not just for a clinician's perspective but from a marine's perspective when you realize that some of these biomarkers they're looking at have some really tangible as i think the researchers are going to prove this this this not only works with uh pervading ptsd that even helps with folks who regard pds but we are particularly interested in this whole issue of resiliency the whole issue of talking about things like working memory capacity and things like nature were an individual we're going to put them through and we've done a lot of creation of stress inoculation training in the last 10 years in fact uh d9 has been very responsible helping us carve that i'm an m3 officer in marine corps my last job by the head of all training in the marine corps and we were building these stress inoculation therapies i mean uh training the devices and whatnot we weren't realizing we may be eroding some of them a capacity for resiliency and so one of the things we've really picked up in the last in in recent months it looks as if this mindfulness in fact doesn't really impact that in a positive sense it has to do with the autonomic nervous system and whatnot and and really makes concrete impact um i i realized about six months ago that if if i'm going to espouse this if i'm going to be able to go to the marine corps and help them to integrate this in the core or the army but i better know more about it myself so i i like wife went to little stanford and i have done somebody told me three years ago hey you're gonna be uh you're gonna meditate say you're gonna stop using drugs you know i'm a high energy guy uh you know on the go a lot i don't need to meditate i want those guys to bring forward if i can do my run each day i can do my pull ups i get my setups i'm good to go i'm here to tell you i mean i have followed the whole curriculum for liz stanley it really works and for somebody that's in four and a half hours sleep you're doing well uh i've if nothing more than just sleep patterns themselves i'm at seven sometimes even eight hours sleep per day i religiously do the the work on mindfulness i did a 30 minute sit in my car just like i did before i met carson ryan last week so it's all anecdotal but i tell you it works um i think that while i uh i i got it i downloaded the congressman porch i i really he didn't pay me to plug his book but his problem probably uh is as well done if not better than all books written on on mindfulness especially chapters on the research and especially chapters on military and first providers it really it really hits it really hits the long ball but i i challenged congressman ryan last week because what he does in each of the the talent of his chapter he said now here's what you can do and so i said to him well here's what you can do i said you can go down to the marine corps with us and i'm going to expose you to marine corps martial arts as a potential vehicle to make sure this is this is going to be accepted by marines the real problem i have the biggest worry i have about about mindfulness is that will it be accepted uh is it going to be touchy-feely in a braincore in a marine's mind in my view when you start showing guys empirical data that it does help with your respiratory your heart rate it does help with working memory capacity what that means to the to the guys and gals and how they how they work each day they'll get that but still it's going to be something where it's kind of integrated into the work day where the because the secret and i've experienced this myself if you don't do it it's not going to work you can't read about it you can't talk about it you actually have to do the exercises i do 40 or so minutes a day and i i myself can tell the the again and girl but i can tell the the impact um but if you don't get something in the military that will be a good vehicle for this then it will not be accepted i know that the marine corps martial arts has been a big big success marines like belts they like to walk around you know stutter study at wearing their black belt or whatever and if we can incorporate this because it's a natural we have we have a we have a mod we have a display down in the marshall arsenal brexits in quantico it says your money is your most important weapon well if that's the case then we're going to really be you know integrate this into into our martial arts program so i i think that uh in my perspective i think it's like a lottery bought that now i think we've we've scored a lot of points on on hyper realistic training uh where or why a marine will our soldier will their first experience in rock or afghanistan will somewhat replicate the last training they've done in the immersion trainer we've had a lot on prolonged exposure there we've got a lot of virtual virtual iraq and virtual afghanistan i do believe that i think that mindfulness for down the road would be one of the most significant things in the paper i heard frank at the end of this year uh i think it was probably the most impactful things that that we do um i have like i said i have integrated into the we've done 37 week-long events with window warriors whereas uh when we started this four years ago we probably have one-third of the participants were were struggling with mental health issues we're now well over two-thirds in fact this last class we had 22 out of 30 that were that were struggling with the mental health session i'm talking about people who have already been diagnosed as you know on the continuum ptsd is only being diagnosed by that by national these are 22 authority of our marines still in activity ready to depart every veteran we're dealing with is already being diagnosed there's no reason for them to come back to this if they're not being diagnosed with ptsd so we've got a growing problem we know that iris works we've seen it a common effect it helps us to establish the team around the person gives them a more of a feeling that the team is there for them and so i'm i'm here to just to forecast but i think that once we insinuate the life of what has said to our week-long sessions we're gonna we're gonna have even more victory down the road and i do predict that that it will be accepted the the first bit of the 12th the marine corps has just been concluded they're going to do two more control trials and i i would be very surprised if it's within a year or so from now it will be a very active part of the of the uh of the marine corps as a d99 talked last week in his office the idea now is how how can we get the energy for this where we can actually we can actually integrate incorporate this across the services i think it has a lot of connotations beyond just uh just making decisions and readiness and whatnot it has a lot of decisions built into just how people report himself and and maybe day-to-day things that some of these crises were dealing with now in the military can be if not obvious at least ameliorated what not um i i am thankful for being here and i i would invite anybody here if you really want to see firsthand what warriors are going through our next session for for the wooden warriors news in the week of seven july come up uh and i'll give you a challenge the v9 has been up here twice and uh it's it's really pretty impactful but the most important thing is you're gonna you'll get you'll learn firsthand some of the demons that some of these folks are are living with and you'll give you more of a realization of what we need to look at for all these different things and how impactful they could be thank you very much what you've described here seems like um i understand the notion that it has to be embraced by the individual that it's targeting but it seems as though there are opportunities to maybe apply what's going on here with um with first responders domestically with some kids who've been raised in very difficult neighborhoods or they've witnessed things that kids should not be witnessing and how this could maybe help their room um well my perspective on that is um i started out when i was i was an atheist kid i hate to tell you this because i don't prohibition twice as a kid i was help if i wasn't helped i wouldn't be here today i'm probably the only general officer in marine corps history has been on probation um so i sorted out the russia to help at-risk youth uh those prevent forest fires rather than put them out later on long before i read his book but after i do this but especially he's got a chapter on how to integrate this in the in the elementary school i think it's very very very useful for children we've been doing kind of irs and meditations i think with kids and special high school kids right but i think that we can i think there's a lot of you killing that man yeah we're um we're pushing it out in education as well we have a social emotional learning bill that we're pushing and in our district was one of the last few remarks we were able to get he started mindfulness social emotional learning curriculum into the school districts in youngstown and northern city schools parents are loving it the teachers are loving it the school district's moving local money to ramp it up to the middle school and then into the high school there are after school programs and summer school programs there's a there's a magazine now it's called mindful and they every couple months published this magazine about secular mindfulness and there's always an education article there's always some about after-school programs the holistic life foundation up in baltimore um three kids if you've ever seen the wire they're in that neighborhood uh doing urban gardening yoga mindfulness and kids who have went through the program 10 years ago are now starting to come back and teach it so it's the same stress and those your brain's doing the same exact thing it's reacting the same exact way your mingling gets fired up it cuts off your prefrontal cortex your emotional system gets out of whack and this all brings it back in same level so i think these programs are essential for for the education piece the after school piece this summer school piece and i think when you look at we lose 20 30 percent of our kids that don't graduate from high school i bet this is not scientifically proven but i bet if you put an fmri on your brain it would look very similar to a vet who has post-traumatic stress so they can't learn because their brain's in stress and their prefrontal cortex is shut down so democrat republican it's like if we spend money on education let's spend it to address the problem and the problem is they don't know how to calm their amygdala down this does that very cheaply so you're right good question i have a question my name is daryl with the office of congressman glenn thompson pennsylvania and i apologize i'm also going to be here you're stuck in markup votes today um but i had a question for the panelists real quick it it relates to uh to you know dr d giovanni you talked about the need for uh for more focus on on stress reduction and resiliency within the force and uh your proposal sounds like a great one to work on going forward my question relates to there are so many programs within department of defense and va right now there are are many dealing with almost every aspect of treatment across the barriers the biggest problem we've run into is that most soldiers and most veterans either don't know they exist or don't know how to access them has been has been they're the biggest problem and with with uh with new programs like conference disorder fitness rolling out and conferencing fitness which are doing a lot of the same things with resiliency and stress production is there a need for another program which would be more focusing on you know either consolidation and promotion of these and saying hey you know here's where you go to get these resources instead of adding more programs or what are your ways i i will tell you that you're exactly right and i'm not advocating a new program what i am advocating for is an institutional approach to teaching those techniques i will also tell you that my fitness is not a course you can't just go to a mind fitness course and then be proficient in it it has to be and we're learning this also on adaptability training i actually got went down this road because i was trying to improve the adaptability and cognition of the of our armed forces and and what i've learned is that this is these kinds of skill sets are not necessarily a course it's the way in which you it's the it's the approach that you take which has to be distributed and reinforced constantly across the entire learning continuum so in the end it doesn't end up being a like okay go to your mind because if that's what it is it will fail you're right go to my fitness course no it has to be integrated into everything else that we're doing so so it's not additive to what they're doing it's it's just part of what you're doing and i i think general jones and i'll steal this summer just for a second and he told me look deanna we got so many dang programs out there nobody knows what to do with them and and and we're throwing everything that we can at all these people and they're doing like you know i give up i'm in boutique stop bombarding me with new programs so it's a very good point i'm sensitive to it that's why my policy wasn't specific to what they're supposed to do or you know what program to do just look we already teach military members how to be physically fit it's we also need to focus on on mental fitness that's all we're saying and you can do you can and you know you can do them at the same time in many cases if you're out running you can you can focus on your mindfulness training while you're running i mean most of us who do run you kind of do some of that already so it's just a matter of integrating it in and changing a little bit of the thought processes but it's an excellent point to piggyback on that i'd say that you know i'm a i'm studying austria i have studied uh comprehensive soldier fitness both of them are viewed by the warriors as administrative requirements as opposed to operational tools i might myself am a real fan of both but neither of them have been effective the way they should have been originally designed i think our what our role is going to be is is developing practices that we can integrate this into the military where it is in fact it's combined with something you've already got mindfulness can do that cool let's hope you have a book signing amazon.com yeah um again friday 9 30 canon 121 if you want to comment actually who's who's doing it this weekend okay we got from inside mindfulness dc we'll be here a little guided meditation so if you want to actually see what's going on in some of these programs these are adapted to obviously deal with the military but this is the same principle and uh yeah sorry um i just wanted to say i'm from congresswoman napolitano's office and she's actually stuck in committee as well so she sends her apologies but wanted to thank you and the military mental caucus for hosting this and all the panelists and your staff thank you thank you so real quick if you're not already on the middle military mental health caucus email list if you could please stop by and just sign our roster right out here outside the door we appreciate that thank you so much

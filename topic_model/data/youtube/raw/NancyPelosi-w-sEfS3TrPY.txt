I yield one minute to the distinguished Leader Nancy Pelosi who has been a steadfast advocate on behalf of the interests of American workers and who has made reauthorization of XM a top priority gentlelady from California is recognized Thank You mr. Speaker I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for her kind words I rise in strong support of the reauthorization of the Exim Bank as a former ranking member on the foreign ops subcommittee of appropriations I saw on a regular basis how important this was to our economy and to small businesses in America and so here today we are coming to the floor in a bipartisan way to create good-paying jobs how many good paying jobs 1.5 million since the year 2007 we're here to reduce the deficit how much are we reducing the deficit in the past two decades seven billion dollars seven billion dollars in money coming in to reduce the deficit this so we're creating jobs good-paying jobs reducing the deficit fueling our economy and we are respecting the Entrepreneurship and the optimism of small and moderate sized businesses across the country yes there are some big businesses that benefit but most of them have subcontractors that need the work of the XM Bank and so when we talk about making it in America I want to recognize the great leadership of our whip mr. Hoyer Make It in America this is what this is about make it in america so that people can make it in america but that also we can find markets abroad for our products made in america and thank you mr. Hoyer for your leadership on that and on the authorization reauthorization of the XM Bank because of all of that work the term made in America that label continues to have the great prestige and quality that we've always known it to have and I want to salute mr. Danny Hecht he was either just remarkable and 24 hours he had 187 co-sponsors his bill earlier this year that's that is so remarkable and then in a short time after that more even more and thank you for all that the work that you have done to bring us to today and to to our Republicans who are supporting this to mr. Fincher that thank you for your leadership and your courage to have give us this opportunity today I want to thank of maxine waters as this has been a long haul as many of you know and over that period of time for one reason or another there were not hearings in the committee of jurisdiction that that could focus on the advantages of the ex-im bank so she had round table after round table bringing in experts on what this meant to our economy bringing in listening to the public hearing from small businesses what this meant to them who would have ever thought that Maxine Waters the ranking member on the Financial Services Committee would be the champion for big moderate and small sized businesses in our country we would have thought it and now the world knows so Maxine thank you for your perseverance you really did such a wonderful job keeping this issue alive recognizing the great leadership we have at the XM Bank with mr. Hawke burden Berg and the others who were there recognizing the hard working people who are there who know about markets and this is important because many Bank many banks that small businesses might go to for a loan or loan guarantees they're not used to dealing with markets abroad and that's why this is such an important link between entrepreneurship creativity on innovation in our country and how it expand markets for all of that throughout the world so I'm really happy congratulations the House of Representatives today we are creating good-paying jobs we are reducing the deficit we are on an entrepreneurship and we're doing it in a bi-partisan life but that I yield back

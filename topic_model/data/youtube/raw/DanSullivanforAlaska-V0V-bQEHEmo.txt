as a Marine I learned the talk is cheap and results are what matter but that's not how they operate in Washington I'm Dan Sullivan and I'm running for the United States Senate because Alaska needs a fighter again not another talker I'll fight for fiscal common sense in a balanced budget I'll fight EPA's bureaucrats to protect Alaska energy production and Alaska jobs and I'll fight to repeal Obamacare I'm Dan Sullivan and I approve this message because we need real results not just talk

my son's name was Carson he was 23 years old he was a wonderful loving son he had a servant's heart he was just the light of my life at the age of 22. he was diagnosed with cancer Carson had a great deal of anxiety over that and then covet hit and his anxiety and his inability to sleep caused him to purchase a pill from Snapchat and we know that it's what killed him his truck was there when I pulled up walked into the living room and I I looked over and saw my son on the living room floor I knew that I couldn't revive him but I called 9-1-1 that was a difficult call to make my healthy beautiful loving caring son was gone the DEA did an investigation and did a sting the individuals served less than 24 hours in jail for my son's death he's on the streets still and I said I was going to make a change because I didn't want another family to ever have to go through what we went through and congresswoman McMorris Rogers is is bringing awareness to this she personally reached out to me and called me she took the time to hear Carson's story as a mother I felt that she could feel my pain she has been so driven in trying to prevent further loss and I am exceptionally thankful for her effort [Music]

well what does it take to get a straight answer out of the government does the nsa collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of americans no sir it does not not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly the implication from widen's office is that clapper's statements were not direct and truthful given the disclosures of the nsa programs this week he just flat out lied it's ridiculous it's an absurd answer i mean look that question that he was asked by wyden was provided to him a day in advance director clapper has been straight and direct in the answers that he's given and has actively engaged in an effort to provide more information about the programs that have been revealed through the leak of classified information is it okay for the dni director to lie to you openly to the american people had it not been for the leaks no one would have known he would have gotten away with it the president has said correctly in my view that a congressional oversight is absolutely essential in this area it's not possible for the congress to do the kind of vigorous oversight that the president spoke about if you can't get straight answer it's appropriate now to have public hearings this will give the committee the american people the opportunity to look at the disclosures that have come out here in the last 10 days or so so fair to say that you're not content with the answers he gave you i know in your statement you said that you gave his office after that hearing a chance to amend it what did he do we sent them the questions ahead of time we indicated to them afterwards there would be an opportunity to amend it and let's rally them what did they do did they respond the answer at the hearing was never mend our obama administration officials lined to congress senator lindsey graham joins us nice to see you sir glad to be with you all right let's talk about dni clapper's statement to response and answer senator wyden's question was he truth or not i think what he's trying to tell us is that we don't monitor your phone calls or the content of your email or your conversations there is no right or privacy towards your phone number regarding your phone number the u.s supreme court in 1979 that's the best i can give you all right the ques the specific question that senator wyatt asked him is does the nsa collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions americans didn't say anything about phone call to say about content and he said no sir senator wyatt said it does not and senator uh dni clapper said not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly yeah we do collect phone numbers the the nsa is collecting phone numbers so that was untruthful well you know all i can tell you is i don't believe what they're telling us about benghazi the irs makes no sense to me i think this administration's got a problem because people don't trust them rightly so when it comes to this program i support it because i think it helps us disrupt terrorist plots that are in the making that's a different issue the question was he truthful yeah well you need to call him back and ask him because we do collect data we don't collect content and collecting the data is lawful and the only way you can get the content to monitor our conversations if a judge issues a warrant allowing the government to do that so there are checks and balances all right you mentioned benghazi and the american people i assume really want to have faith and trust yeah yeah you've got benghazi yeah the irs targeting you've got uh uh you've got attorney general holder asking about potential uh prosecution media media he said no and then you got clapper and you got clapper and you know it's like i don't know i mean i don't know how i you know i don't know how you get around what clapper said and i was a defense lawyer i don't know how i'd spend that one to say anything but that he was being that he was just he simply didn't tell the truth all i can tell you is from my point of view i want to do two things i want the government to be honest and accountable and i want to make sure we disrupt terrorist plots before they mature this program has checks and balances no one can listen into your phone calls or mine without a warrant being issued by a federal judge they have to show the judge that the tariffs that we're following has made a phone call to your number before we can monitor content that's that's entirely different that's entirely that's where the program works right that's an entirely different question than whether the administration that we want to have confidence in is being is playing it fast i totally agree with you i think the problem we have here is that you got an administration that told a story about benghazi that not did not withstand scrutiny the president himself blamed the attack on a video in a spontaneous riot that was just really illogical there was no evidence of anything other than a coordinated terrorist attack the irs case you've got a lady taking the fifth amendment saying this was limited to cincinnati office when the people in cincinnati said they got direction from washington you got jim rosen's situation where the attorney general said he had no knowledge of a pending or potential criminal investigation of reporter when he signed documents allowing jim rosen to be listed as criminal coastal co-conspirator now you got clapper saying we don't collect any data all of that makes it really difficult for lindsey graham to come on your program and say when it comes to the nsa program i understand it their checks and balances i know about it the courts are involved we don't have to just rely upon clapper and the administration okay if if clapper i'm using clapper's example if clapper under oath makes this statement in response to the senator's answer and you don't trust that you don't trust that he was being truthful how in the world can we have the dni the highest ranking intelligence officer in our nation how in the world can we trust when he goes to work every single day this one's under oath yeah now this is a real problem i don't trust what the intelligence what the white house is telling us about how the talking points got changed who was in that saturday meeting what did the president do that night the irs i can give you a list of things you should we elect at least at least of the president for you know whether you agree that he's elected right this is this is an appointment uh by the president call him back and and listen call clapper back and say i wish i could call you know unless called holder back but here's i wish i could you're the one who's in the senate i wish i could too but here's the one thing i want to tell the american people for in spite of all this behavior you should really be concerned about we're under threat from radical islam they're trying to attack our homeland every day there are plots being formed throughout the world directed at us at home and abroad and we need to stop them if we can't i don't think i don't think anyone disagrees with two things though i don't think i think everyone wants to stop terrorism i want to stop terrorism but but i have questioned about whether this program works because we were tipped off by the russians to tsarnaev in boston and somehow even with a tip off we couldn't figure that one out so that's the first question the second question is in terms of the president saying that he's not that we're not they're not listening to the content i think the mere phone numbers you uh that you call can be very revealing about you suppose you make a call to suicide hotline or an abortion clinic or a tea party it tells you an awful lot about you without listening to the content so i think there is a deeper deeper involvement of privacy than just simply a random set of numbers listen to this because you know i'm very involved in in helping create this program and having checks and balances phone numbers are not attached to a name the only time that anybody can monitor content is when a terrorist known terrorist phone number is connected to a number in the united states then you have to get permission from the court to identify the person that would be really convincing but for the fact we've got a guy who's three months at a government contractor booz allen and he somehow got access to all this stuff so i don't believe that if a three-month contractor can get get part of the confidential information secret stuff why shouldn't i think it's a four-month contractor doesn't get the phone numbers and time into the people all i can tell you is that the people who have access to this program are in the dozens not in the hundreds and they have a paper trail a uh so did this guy got caught all i can tell you is that this guy is not a patriot in my opinion he's a potential felon and you shouldn't believe everything he tells you but the one thing you should he did he did produce a court order the fisa court order that is a sealed secret order but these orders are just issued every 90 days to allow the the the government to date it shows there's access to seek a secret stuff by rogue people all i can tell you is that this is not the first time someone has revealed information about classified programs and every time this happens we become weaker and how much more are we going to tell the terrorists about what we're trying to do to follow them around and stop them from from striking the united nations i mean excuse me in the united states how much are we going to tell the terrorists before we lose our ability to defend our homeland i don't want your phone calls to be listened to or my phone calls to be listened to unless there's a damn good reason and a federal judge is involved we don't have to trust the obama administration or clapper you got a federal judge whose job it is to oversee this program and i think it works well and i can promise you this we have stopped terrorist attacks before they were executed because of this program and if we lose this program we don't interrogate detainees anymore we kill them and the ones we catch we read them their miranda rights like in boston we're not collecting human intelligence if we destroy this technological intelligence program then we're really in trouble senator thank you we have a lot more to talk about so you now have a we'll have another conversation thank you sir be continued and many americans

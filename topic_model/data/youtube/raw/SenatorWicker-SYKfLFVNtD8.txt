and senator Roger wicker of Mississippi was also at that White House session today I started by asking him if the president's engagement has more pressure on Republicans well I guess there is some pressure on on some of the people who who are sort of still doubtful about this I don't feel the pressure because I've been a yes vote for quite some time but let me tell you there there are two schools of thought on moving forward the majority leader Senator McConnell would like to get to a vote on the motion to proceed and see where people are and if we win great we proceed to the bill if not at least people have voted and we know what the target is we lose by two votes or three votes the president on the other hand really thinks that over the next few days we can get 50 votes to yes and he was all about today getting into the details what's keeping various members from from being able to say 100 percent that they can support this legislation and deciding what levers to pull to get the bill to a place where 50 of us can say yes well the reason I'm asking about pressure is because a couple of weeks ago when senator Dean Heller of Nevada indicated he was having problems with the legislation there was a political action group supporting the president that ran ads against him is that it and I think that was generally considered to be bad form and counterproductive among people in the Republican Conference well let me ask you a little bit about the substance of this as you know a lot of discussion about what this bill would mean for coverage including Medicaid the vice president of your home state of Mississippi State Hospital Association quoted this week as saying they are opposed to anything that increases the number of uninsured in Mississippi well for one thing I don't think it would increase the number of uninsured these these changes are based on on projections of people that will be covered if the estimates are correct so I would just challenge that but let me also say and I don't mean to be critical or or I don't mean this to be taken wrong but there's never been a provider who came to us and said we need you to slow the growth rate of these entitlement programs that's just not something that they're going to say but the fact is we can make health care better for Mississippians and we can make coverage better for the average Americans while at the same time saving a system that is not sustainable for future generations we can do that and at the end of the day I think people in the healthcare business and the hospital business in future years will say you've saved the system and good for you so when I read that they're almost half a million children in Mississippi who depend on Medicaid are you saying they don't have anything to worry about I think well for one thing we are not a Medicaid expansion right our state did not choose to do that and so it's completely inaccurate to say that these 500,000 children are going to lose their coverage they're not as a matter of fact there will be a tradition and there will be a transition I'm sorry and in states that expanded Medicaid will have a 7 year period and there will be an extra incentive for those states who chose not to do that but but those 500,000 children that you talked about are not going to have their coverage threatened all right senator Roger wicker joining us from the Capitol we thank you thank you

uh thank you mr chairman and uh i want to thank the panelists for being here today very uh illuminating and informative and helpful um one one special person i do want to recognize i know miss ross has a special guest assistant with her aunt sorry it's our jobs as parents to embarrass our kids i've got kids about the same age but glad you've participated and frankly i will note that you had more stamina than most of the members of congress making it through a two-hour plus hearing so but this is why we're doing this this is why we are all here is to make sure our kids and our grandkids have a better future than what we have and that's why this question this this issue is so important to what we are talking about and that really is i think the common motivator for so many of us um i did hear a couple of common themes today um common theme of one china cheats this is china writ large it could be the chinese communist party it could be the uh the chinese army could be all of the business entities that are either shell or they might be partially related or whatever they are but we know that china does cheat we also know that china controls things as much as they possibly can and we know that number three china is out for china they are not out for their investors they are not out for their citizens they are not out for the world economy they're out for china and their way of life and their governmental structure and i would think that if you can accept one two and three then you have to ask the question how will additional rules requirements demands temper tantrums whatever it is how is that going to change china's actions and that's what this is about and i don't think those things will what does get china's attention is sanctions economic pressure sanctions and a strong robust u.s economy that can not just compete but can actually outdo can offer even better options than what they can and not just in our country but around the world so we need a positive environment for our entrepreneurs our small innovators our risk takers the things that have made the us such a powerful force in this world and a force for good by the way there's more people that have been lifted out of poverty with capitalism versus socialism or communism there are more opportunities that have happened across the board for every single citizen of uh of any country that has has taken that route and we need to encourage that and i i just want to emphasize that as we're looking at lots of discussions outside of this committee as well what uh what is going to be getting done uh here uh in in our economy we need to be conscious of this what is separating us from other areas and other countries in the world like china and how are we going to maintain our edge and it is through creating an environment that allows others to succeed and for us to succeed so with that mr chairman i do appreciate you doing this hearing today and uh i look forward to the conversation look forward to learning more about your uh your your bills that you have uh are in the process of uh drafting and uh looking forward to this continuation

We're going to change the 2008 trafficking law, which basically says that if you come into the United States from Central America, you'll be treated just like we treat the Mexicans with a very swift removal from the United States back to your country of origin. You know, back home in a humane way, and secondly, deploying the National Guard.\"\n",

What is Harry Reid going to do with that?\"\n",

You mentioned that the DACA, the 2012 executive action that, in my judgment, circumvented the Congress. We're going to reign that one in as well with the vote on the floor reign that in so that this president can no longer do that.

Why is it, Chairman, the federal government isn't telling state governors who are going to be on the hook for school and welfare and food and stuff like that, that they're sending these kids there?\"\n",

Why aren't you telling us where you're putting these children because the governors need to know. The county officials need to know. This will impact every member's district across the nation. And I think to Mike Pence's point, you know, under state laws we have to, we are required to educate the children, in these cases, the children. I've seen, quite frankly, their native dialect is an Indian dialect. It's not even Spanish. They would be put into a special ed type class, translators. This is why we need to stop the flow.
